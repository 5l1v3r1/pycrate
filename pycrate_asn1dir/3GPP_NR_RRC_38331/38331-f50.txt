4.2	Architecture
4.2.1	UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is either in RRC_CONNECTED state or in RRC_INACTIVE state when an RRC connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:
-	RRC_IDLE:
-	A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;
-	UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
-	The UE:
-	Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
-	Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
-	Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured).
-	RRC_INACTIVE:
-	A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;
-	UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
-	The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;
-	A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;
The UE:
-	Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
-	Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN paging using fullI-RNTI;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
-	Performs RAN-based notification area updates periodically and when moving outside the configured RAN-based notification area;
-	Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured).
-	RRC_CONNECTED:
-	The UE stores the AS context;
-	Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;
-	At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;
-	For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the SpCell, for increased bandwidth;
-	For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for increased bandwidth;
-	Network controlled mobility within NR and to/from E-UTRA;
-	The UE:
-	Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5), if configured;
-	Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to determine if data is scheduled for it;
-	Provides channel quality and feedback information;
-	Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
-	Acquires system information.
Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates an overview of UE RRC state machine and state transitions in NR. A UE has only one RRC state in NR at one time.

4.2.2	Signalling radio bearers
"Signalling Radio Bearers" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RBs) that are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the following SRBs are defined:
-	SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
-	SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;
-	SRB2 is for NAS messages, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS security activation;
-	SRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in EN-DC, all using DCCH logical channel.
In downlink piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for bearer establishment/modification/release. In uplink piggybacking of NAS message is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup and connection resume.
NOTE 1:	The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2 and SRB3, including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages, see TS 24.501 [23].
Editor's Note:	FFS which SRBs are used for NE-DC, NR-NR DC.
4.3	Services
4.3.1	Services provided to upper layers
The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:
-	Broadcast of common control information;
-	Notification of UEs in RRC_IDLE, e.g. about a mobile terminating call;
-	Notification of UEs about ETWS and/or CMAS
-	Transfer of dedicated signalling.
4.3.2	Services expected from lower layers
In brief, the following are the main services that RRC expects from lower layers:
-	Integrity protection, ciphering and loss-less in-sequence delivery of information without duplication;
4.4	Functions
The RRC protocol includes the following main functions:
-	Broadcast of system information:
-	Including NAS common information;
-	Information applicable for UEs in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE (e.g. cell (re-)selection parameters, neighbouring cell information) and information (also) applicable for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED (e.g. common channel configuration information);
-	Including ETWS notification, CMAS notification.
-	RRC connection control:
-	Paging;
-	Establishment/modification/suspension/resumption/release of RRC connection, including e.g. assignment/modification of UE identity (C-RNTI, fullI-RNTI, etc.), establishment/modification/suspension/resumption/release of SRBs (except for SRB0);
-	Access barring;
-	Initial AS security activation, i.e. initial configuration of AS integrity protection (SRBs, DRBs) and AS ciphering (SRBs, DRBs);
-	RRC connection mobility including e.g. intra-frequency and inter-frequency handover, associated AS security handling, i.e. key/algorithm change, specification of RRC context information transferred between network nodes;
-	Establishment/modification/suspension/resumption/release of RBs carrying user data (DRBs);
-	Radio configuration control including e.g. assignment/modification of ARQ configuration, HARQ configuration, DRX configuration;
-	In case of DC, cell management including e.g. change of PSCell, addition/modification/release of SCG cell(s);
-	In case of CA, cell management including e.g. addition/modification/release of SCell(s);
-	QoS control including assignment/ modification of semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) configuration and configured grant configuration for DL and UL respectively, assignment/ modification of parameters for UL rate control in the UE, i.e. allocation of a priority and a prioritised bit rate (PBR) for each RB.
-	Recovery from radio link failure.
-	Inter-RAT mobility including e.g. AS security activation, transfer of RRC context information;
-	Measurement configuration and reporting:
-	Establishment/modification/release of measurement configuration (e.g. intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter- RAT measurements);
-	Setup and release of measurement gaps;
-	Measurement reporting.
-	Other functions including e.g. generic protocol error handling, transfer of dedicated NAS information, transfer of UE radio access capability information.
5	Procedures
5.1	General
5.1.1	Introduction
This section covers the general requirements.
5.1.2	General requirements
The UE shall:
1>	process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a subsequent message;
NOTE:	Network may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the UE's response of a previously initiated procedure.
1>	within a sub-clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the procedural description;
1>	consider the term 'radio bearer' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs unless explicitly stated otherwise;
1>	set the rrc-TransactionIdentifier in the response message, if included, to the same value as included in the message received from the network that triggered the response message;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to setup:
2>	apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to release:
2>	clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated resources;
1>	in case the size of a list is extended, upon receiving an extension field comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the original field (regardless of whether the network signals more entries in total); apply the following generic behaviour unless explicitly stated otherwise:
2>	create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included in the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order among both the original and the additional entries;
2>	for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same behaviour as defined for the original field.
5.1.3	Requirements for UE in EN-DC
In this specification, the UE considers itself to be in EN-DC if and only if it is configured with nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig according to TS 36.331[10].
NOTE:	This use of the term EN-DC deviates from the definition in TS 37.340 [41] and other specifications. In TS 37.340, the term EN-DC includes also the case where the UE is configured with E-UTRA MCG only (i.e. no NR SCG) but with one or more bearers terminated in a secondary node (i.e. using NR PDCP).
The UE in EN-DC only executes a sub-clause of clause 5 in this specification when the subclause:
-	is referred to from a subclause under execution, either in this specification or in TS 36.331 [10]; or
-	applies to a message received on SRB3 (if SRB3 is established); or
-	applies to field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s) or timer(s) in this specification that the UE is configured with.
When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE follows the requirements in clause 5.1.2 and in all subclauses of this specification applicable to the messages (including processing time requirements), fields, IEs, timers and UE variables indicated in the subclause under execution.
5.2	System information
5.2.1	Introduction
System Information (SI) is divided into the MIB and a number of SIBs where:
-	the MIB is always transmitted on the BCH with a periodicity of 80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms (TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.1) and it includes parameters that are needed to acquire SIB1 from the cell. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframes as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1 and repetitions are scheduled according to the period of SSB;
-	the SIB1 is transmitted on the DL-SCH with a periodicity of 160 ms and variable transmission repetition periodicity within 160 ms as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13. The default transmission repetition periodicity of SIB1 is 20 ms but the actual transmission repetition periodicity is up to network implementation. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, SIB1 repetition transmission period is 20 ms. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2/3, SIB1 transmission repetition period is the same as the SSB period (TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). SIB1 includes information regarding the availability and scheduling (e.g. mapping of SIBs to SI message, periodicity, SI-window size) of other SIBs with an indication whether one or more SIBs are only provided on-demand and, in that case, the configuration needed by the UE to perform the SI request. SIB1 is cell-specific SIB;
-	SIBs other than SIB1 are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Only SIBs having the same periodicity can be mapped to the same SI message. Each SI message is transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows with same length for all SI messages). Each SI message is associated with an SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI message is transmitted. An SI message may be transmitted a number of times within the SI-window. Any SIB except SIB1 can be configured to be cell specific or area specific, using an indication in SIB1. The cell specific SIB is applicable only within a cell that provides the SIB while the area specific SIB is applicable within an area referred to as SI area, which consists of one or several cells and is identified by systemInformationAreaID;
-	For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the network can provide system information through dedicated signalling using the RRCReconfiguration message, e.g. if the UE has an active BWP with no common search space configured to monitor system information or paging.
-	For PSCell and SCells, the network provides the required SI by dedicated signalling, i.e. within an RRCReconfiguration message. Nevertheless, the UE shall acquire MIB of the PSCell to get SFN timing of the SCG (which may be different from MCG). Upon change of relevant SI for SCell, the network releases and adds the concerned SCell. For PSCell, SI can only be changed with Reconfiguration with Sync.
NOTE:	The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take. The maximum SIB1 or SI message size is 2976 bits.
5.2.2	System information acquisition
5.2.2.1	General UE requirements

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition
The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS- and NAS information. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and in RRC_CONNECTED.
The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of (at least) the MIB, SIB1 through SIB4 and SIB5 (if the UE supports E-UTRA).
5.2.2.2	SIB validity and need to (re)-acquire SIB
5.2.2.2.1	SIB validity
The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return from out of coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after entering the network from another RAT, upon receiving an indication that the system information has changed, upon receiving a PWS notification; and whenever the UE does not have a valid version of a stored SIB.
When the UE acquires a MIB or a SIB1 or an SI message in a serving cell as described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired SIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList, the cellIdentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, and the valueTag, if present, as indicated in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB. The UE may use a valid stored version of the SI except MIB, SIB1, SIB6, SIB7 or SIB8 e.g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after the reception of SI change indication.
NOTE:	The storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the SIBs valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.
The UE shall:
1>	delete any stored version of a SIB after 3 hours from the moment it was successfully confirmed as valid;
1>	for each stored version of a SIB:
2>	if the areaScope is associated and its value for the stored version of the SIB is the same as the value received in the si-SchedulingInfo for that SIB from the serving cell:
3>	if the first PLMN-Identity included in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the PLMN-Identity, the systemInformationAreaID and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:
4>	consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
2>	if the areaScope is not present for the stored version of the SIB and the areaScope value is not included in the si-SchedulingInfo for that SIB from the serving cell:
3>	if the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList, the cellIdentity and valueTag that are included in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the PLMN-Identity, the cellIdentity and the valueTag associated with the stored version of that SIB:
4>	consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
5.2.2.2.2	SI change indication and PWS notification
A modification period is used, i.e. updated SI (other than for ETWS and CMAS) is broadcasted in the modification period following the one where SI change indication is transmitted. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m = 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by system information. The UE receives indications about SI modifications and/or PWS notifications using Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). Repetitions of SI change indication may occur within preceding modification period.
UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor for SI change indication in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification period if the UE is provided with common search space on the active BWP to monitor paging, as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor for indications about PWS notification in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once every defaultPagingCycle if the UE is provided with common search space on the active BWP to monitor paging.
If the UE receives a Short Message, the UE shall:
1>	if the UE is ETWS capable or CMAS capable, and the etwsAndCmasIndication bit of Short Message is set:
2> immediately re-acquire the SIB1;
2>	if the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB6:
3>	acquire SIB6, as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2>	if the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB7:
3>	acquire SIB7, as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2>	if the UE is CMAS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB8:
3>	acquire SIB8, as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
1> if the systemInfoModification bit of Short Message is set:
2>	apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in sub-clause 5.2.2.3 from the start of the next modification period.
5.2.2.3	Acquisition of System Information
5.2.2.3.1	Acquisition of MIB and SIB1
The UE shall:
1>	apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;
1>	if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE:
2>	acquire the MIB, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	if the UE is unable to acquire the MIB;
3>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
2>	else:
3>	perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1.
1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1 and pagingSearchSpace and has received an indication about change of system information; or
1>	if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE:
2>	if ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates SIB1 is transmitted in the cell (TS 38.213 [13]) and if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE:
3>	acquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
3>	if the UE is unable to acquire the SIB1:
4>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
3>	else:
4>	upon acquiring SIB1, perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2.
2>	else if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE and ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is not scheduled in the cell:
3>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.
NOTE:	The UE in RRC_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted SIB1 if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
5.2.2.3.2	Acquisition of an SI message
For SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined according to searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message are determined based on search space indicated by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the SI window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion (s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in SI-window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the SI window, PDCCH for an SI message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception SI messages is up to UE implementation.
When acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:
1>	determine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as follows:
2>	for the concerned SI message, determine the number n which corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo in SIB1;
2>	determine the integer value x = (n – 1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
2>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N), where T is the si-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
1>	receive the PDCCH containing the scheduling RNTI, i.e. SI-RNTI in the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for SI message acquisition, from the start of the SI-window and continue until the end of the SI-window whose absolute length in time is given by si-WindowLength, or until the SI message was received;
1>	if the SI message was not received by the end of the SI-window, repeat reception at the next SI-window occasion for the concerned SI message in the current modification period;
NOTE 1:	The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SI message if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
NOTE 2:	The UE is not required to monitor PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) corresponding to each transmitted SSB in SI-window.
NOTE 3:	If the concerned SI message was not received in the current modification period, handling of SI message acquisition is left to UE implementation.
1>	perform the actions for the acquired SI message as specified in sub-clause 5.2.2.4.
5.2.2.3.3	Request for on demand system information

5.3	Connection control
5.3.1	Introduction
5.3.1.1	RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. The network completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the NG connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the 5GC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful AS security activation. However, the UE only accepts a re-configuration with sync message when AS security has been activated.
Upon receiving the UE context from the 5GC, the RAN activates AS security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial AS security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate AS security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate AS security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2 and DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered. After having initiated the initial AS security activation procedure, the network may initiate the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. the network may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial AS security activation from the UE. In any case, the network will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2 and DRBs. The network should release the RRC connection if the initial AS security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an E-UTRA carrier frequency.
The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any configuration received from the network, and transits to RRC_INACTIVE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered.
The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN paging from NG-RAN. When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates AS security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s).
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection, the network may resume the suspended RRC connection and send UE to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE (with a wait timer), or directly re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery (in this case the network sends an RRC setup message).

5.3.1.2	AS Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection and ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the AS security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm, if integrity protection and/or ciphering is enabled for a DRB and two parameters, namely the keySetChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon reconfiguration with sync (with key change), connection re-establishment and/or connection resume.
The integrity protection and ciphering algorithm is common for signalling radio bearers SRB1 and SRB2. When not configured with any kind of DC, the ciphering and integrity protection algorithm is common for all radio bearers (i.e. SRB1, SRB2 and DRBs). All DRBs related to the same PDU session have the same AS security configuration. Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
Editor′s Note:	FFS NE-DC, NR-NR-DC related AS security parameters such as SK-counter and S-KgNB.
RRC integrity protection and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/procedure. RRC integrity protection and ciphering for SRBs are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a 'NULL' ciphering algorithm (nea0).
The 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm (nia0) is used only for SRBs and for the UE in limited service mode, see TS 33.501 [11] and when used for SRBs, integrity protection is disabled for DRBs. In case the ′NULL' integrity protection algorithm is used, 'NULL' ciphering algorithm is also used.
NOTE 1:	Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity protection check has failed and indicate the integrity protection verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies four different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc), one for integrity protection of user data (KUPint) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). All four AS keys are derived from the KgNB key. The KgNB key is based on the KAMF key (as specified in TS 33.501 [11]), which is handled by upper layers.
The integrity protection and ciphering algorithms can only be changed with reconfiguration with sync. The AS keys (KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint and KUPenc) change upon reconfiguration with sync (if masterKeyUpdate is included), and upon connection re-establishment and connection resume.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]) is maintained for each direction. For each radio bearer, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering and integrity protection. It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (TX_HFN and RX_HFN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the network. The network is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g. use different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security key, or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and then to RRC_CONNECTED transition.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.

5.3.5	RRC reconfiguration
5.3.5.1	General

Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC reconfiguration, successful

Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to establish/modify/release RBs, to perform reconfiguration with sync, to setup/modify/release measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and cell groups. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from the Network to the UE.
In EN-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration and reporting, to (re-)configure MAC, RLC, physical layer and RLF timers and constants of the SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs associated with the S-KgNB or SRB3, provided that the (re-)configuration does not require any MeNB involvement.
5.3.5.2	Initiation
The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:
-	the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the reconfigurationWithSync is included in secondaryCellGroup only when at least one DRB is setup in SCG;
-	the reconfigurationWithSync is included in masterCellGroup only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended.

3>	if reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig of an SCG:
4>	initiate the random access procedure on the SpCell, as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
3>	else:
4>	the procedure ends;
NOTE 1:	The order the UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message and performs the random access procedure towards the SCG is left to UE implementation.
2>	else (RRCReconfiguration was received via SRB3):
3>	submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via SRB3 to lower layers for transmission using the new configuration;
NOTE 2:	In EN-DC, in the case RRCReconfiguration is received via SRB1, the random access is triggered by RRC layer itself as there is not necessarily other UL transmission. In the case RRCReconfiguration is received via SRB3, the random access is triggered by the MAC layer due to arrival of RRCReconfigurationComplete.
1>	else:
2>	submit the RRCReconfigurationComplete message via SRB1 to lower layers for transmission using the new configuration;
2>	if this is the first RRCReconfiguration message after successful completion of the RRC re-establishment procedure:
3>	resume SRB2 and DRBs that are suspended;

2>	stop timer T304 for that cell group;
2>	apply the parts of the CQI reporting configuration, the scheduling request configuration and the sounding RS configuration that do not require the UE to know the SFN of the respective target SpCell, if any;

2>	if the reconfigurationWithSync was included in spCellConfig of an MCG:
3>	if T390 is running:
4>	stop timer T390 for all access categories;

3>	if RRCReconfiguration does not include dedicatedSIB1-Delivery and
3>	if the active downlink BWP, which is indicated by the firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id for the target SpCell of the MCG, has a common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1:
4>	acquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13], of the target SpCell of the MCG;
4>	upon acquiring SIB1, perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2;
2>	the procedure ends.
NOTE 3:	The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SIB1 if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
5.3.5.4	Secondary cell group release
The UE shall:
1>	as a result of SCG release triggered by E-UTRA:
2>	reset SCG MAC, if configured;

The network configures the UE with Master Cell Group (MCG), and zero or one Secondary Cell Group (SCG). In EN-DC, the MCG is configured as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. The network provides the configuration parameters for a cell group in the CellGroupConfig IE.
The UE performs the following actions based on a received CellGroupConfig IE:
1>	if the CellGroupConfig contains the spCellConfig with reconfigurationWithSync:
2>	perform Reconfiguration with sync according to 5.3.5.5.2;
2>	resume all suspended radio bearers and resume SCG transmission for all radio bearers, if suspended;

NOTE 1:	Void.
NOTE 2:	When determining whether a drb-Identity value is part of the current UE configuration, the UE does not distinguish which RadioBearerConfig and DRB-ToAddModList that DRB was originally configured in. To re-associate a DRB with a different key (KeNB to S-KgNB or vice versa), the network provides the drb-Identity value in the (target) drb-ToAddModList and sets the reestablishPDCP flag. The network does not list the drb-Identity in the (source) drb-ToReleaseList.
NOTE 3:	When setting the reestablishPDCP flag for a radio bearer, the network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering a reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by releasing the old RLC entity.
NOTE 4:	In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 5: Ciphering and integrity protection can be enabled or disabled for a DRB. The enabling/disabling of ciphering or integrity protection can be changed only by releasing and adding the DRB.

5.3.6	Counter check
5.3.6.1	General

Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to verify the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT match with the values indicated by the network.
NOTE:	The procedure enables the network to detect packet insertion by an intruder (a 'man in the middle').
5.3.6.2	Initiation
The network initiates the procedure by sending a CounterCheck message.
 NOTE:	The network may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches a specific value.
5.3.6.3	Reception of the CounterCheck message by the UE
Upon receiving the CounterCheck message, the UE shall:
1>	for each DRB that is established:
2>	if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3>	assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2>	if the drb-Identity is not included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:
3>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT – 1 and RX_NEXT – 1 (specified in TS 38.323 [5]), respectively;

The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least one DRB setup, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds if the network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE context cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an RRCSetup according to clause 5.3.3.4. If AS security has not been activated, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'other'. If AS security has been activated, but SRB2 and at least one DRB are not setup, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'RRC connection failure'.
The network applies the procedure e.g as follows:
-	When AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or verifies the UE context:
-	to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;
-	to re-establish and resume the SRB1;
-	When UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context:
-	to discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs;
-	to fallback to establish a new RRC connection.

5.4	Inter-RAT mobility
5.4.1	Introduction
Network controlled inter-RAT mobility between NR and E-UTRA is supported, where E-UTRA can be connected to either EPC or 5GC.5.4.2	Handover to NR
5.4.2.1	General

Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to NR, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g. E-UTRAN) to NR.
The handover to NR procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from E-UTRA to NR applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRA.
5.4.2.2	Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the handover to NR procedure, in accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending the RRCReconfiguration message via the radio access technology from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.
The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated in the other RAT;
-	to re-establish SRBs and one or more DRBs;
5.4.2.3	Reception of the RRCReconfiguration by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	perform RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5;
NOTE:	If the UE is connected to 5GC of the source E-UTRA cell, the delta configuration for PDCP and SDAP can be used for intra-system inter-RAT handover.
5.4.3	Mobility from NR
5.4.3.1	General

Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from NR, successful

Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from NR, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using other RAT, e.g. E-UTRA. The mobility from NR procedure covers the following type of mobility:
-	handover, i.e. the MobilityFromNRCommand message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
5.4.3.2	Initiation
The network initiates the mobility from NR procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport message, by sending a MobilityFromNRCommand message. The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	the procedure is initiated only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB are setup and not suspended.
5.4.3.3	Reception of the MobilityFromNRCommand by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	if T390 is running:
2>	stop timer T390 for all access categories;
2>	perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
1>	if the targetRAT-Type is set to eutra:
2>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
2>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromNR to the upper layers, if included;
1>	access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the target RAT.
5.4.3.4	Successful completion of the mobility from NR
Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE shall:
1>	reset MAC;
1>	stop all timers that are running;
1>	release ran-NotificationAreaInfo, if stored;
1>	release the AS security context including the KRRCenc key, the KRRCint key, the KUPint key and the KUPenc key, if stored;
1>	release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and the MAC configuration;
1>	if the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message included in the received MobilityFromNRCommand does not include fullConfig:
2>	maintain source RAT configuration of PDCP and SDAP for applicable RBs which is used for target RAT RBs;
1>	else:
2>	release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all established RBs;
1>	indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together with the release cause 'other'.
5.4.3.5	Mobility from NR failure
The UE shall:
1>	if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target radio access technology; or
1>	if the UE is unable to comply with any part of the configuration included in the MobilityFromNRCommand message; or
1>	if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the MobilityFromNRCommand message, causing the UE to fail the procedure according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:
2>	revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;
2>	initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in subclause 5.3.7.
5.5	Measurements
5.5.1	Introduction
The network may configure an RRC_CONNECTED UE to perform measurements and report them in accordance with the measurement configuration. The measurement configuration is provided by means of dedicated signalling i.e. using the RRCReconfiguration.
The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of measurements:
-	NR measurements;
-	Inter-RAT measurements of E-UTRA frequencies.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement information based on SS/PBCH block(s):
-	Measurement results per SS/PBCH block;
-	Measurement results per cell based on SS/PBCH block(s);
-	SS/PBCH block(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement information based on CSI-RS resources:
-	Measurement results per CSI-RS resource;
-	Measurement results per cell based on CSI-RS resource(s);
-	CSI-RS resource measurement identifiers.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1.	Measurement objects: A list of objects on which the UE shall perform the measurements.
-	For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time location and subcarrier spacing of reference signals to be measured. Associated with this measurement object, the network may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'blacklisted' cells and a list of 'whitelisted' cells. Blacklisted cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting. Whitelisted cells are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	The measObjectId of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell is indicated by servingCellMO within the serving cell configuration.
-	For inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency, the network can configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'blacklisted' cells and a list of 'whitelisted' cells. Blacklisted cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting. Whitelisted cells are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
2.	Reporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where there can be one or multiple reporting configurations per measurement object. Each reporting configuration consists of the following:
-	Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.
-	RS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement results (SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).
-	Reporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE includes in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated information such as the maximum number of cells and the maximum number beams per cell to report.
3.	Measurement identities: A list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities, it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is also included in the measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network.
4.	Quantity configurations: The quantity configuration defines the measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that measurement. For NR measurements, the network may configure up to 2 quantity configurations with a reference in the NR measurement object to the configuration that is to be used. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for different measurement quantities, for different RS types, and for measurements per cell and per beam.
5.	Measurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this specification. The measurement object list possibly includes NR measurement object(s) and inter-RAT objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes NR and inter-RAT reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1.	The NR serving cell(s) – these are the SpCell and one or more SCells.
2.	Listed cells – these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3.	Detected cells – these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB frequency(ies) and subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement object(s).
For NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s), listed cells and/or detected cells. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and detected cells.
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in sub-clause 5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.
5.5.2	Measurement configuration
5.5.2.1	General
The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to ensure that, whenever the UE has a measConfig, it includes a measObject for the SpCell and for each NR SCell to be measured;
-	to configure at most one measurement identity using a reporting configuration with the reportType set to reportCGI;
-	to ensure that for all SSB based measurements there is at most one measurement object with the same ssbFrequency;
-	to ensure that all measurement objects configured in this specification and in TS 36.331 [10] with the same ssbFrequency have the same ssbSubcarrierSpacing;
-	to ensure that a smtc1 included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value, and that a smtc2 included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value;
-	to ensure that, if a measurement object has the same ssbFrequency as a measurement object configured in TS 36.331 [10]:
-	for that ssbFrequency, the measurement window according to the smtc configured in TS 36.331 [10] includes the measurement window according to the smtc1 configured in TS 38.331, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
-	if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in measurementSlots in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to the same value. Also, the endSymbol is the same in both objects.

5.5.3	Performing measurements
5.5.3.1	General
An RRC_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring one or multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network, as described in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria and measurement reporting. For cell measurements, the network can configure RSRP, RSRQ or SINR as trigger quantity. Reporting quantities can be any combination of quantities (i.e. RSRP and RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR), irrespective of the trigger quantity.
The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in 5.5.3.3a. If beam measurement information is configured to be included in measurement reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2. On the other hand, the exact L1 filtering of beam measurements used to derive cell measurement results is implementation dependent.
The UE shall:
1>	whenever the UE has a measConfig, perform RSRP and RSRQ measurements for each serving cell for which servingCellMO is configured as follows:
2>	if the reportConfig associated with at least one measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig contains an rsType set to ssb and ssb-ConfigMobility is configured in the measObject indicated by the servingCellMO:

3>	derive serving cell measurement results based on SS/PBCH block, as described in 5.5.3.3;

3>	derive serving cell SINR based on CSI-RS, as described in 5.5.3.3;
1>	for each measId included in the measIdList within VarMeasConfig:
2>	if the reportType for the associated reportConfig is set to reportCGI:
3>	perform the corresponding measurements on the frequency and RAT indicated in the associated measObject using available idle periods;
3>	if the cell indicated by reportCGI field for the associated measObject is an NR cell and that indicated cell is broadcasting SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13):
4>	try to acquire SIB1 in the concerned cell;
3>	if the cell indicated by reportCGI field is an E-UTRA cell:
4>	try to acquire SystemInformationBlockType1 in the concerned cell;
2>	if the reportType for the associated reportConfig is periodical or eventTriggered:
3>	if a measurement gap configuration is setup, or
3>	if the UE does not require measurement gaps to perform the concerned measurements:
4>	if s-MeasureConfig is not configured, or
4>	if s-MeasureConfig is set to ssb-RSRP and the NR SpCell RSRP based on SS/PBCH block, after layer 3 filtering, is lower than ssb-RSRP, or
4>	if s-MeasureConfig is set to csi-RSRP and the NR SpCell RSRP based on CSI-RS, after layer 3 filtering, is lower than csi-RSRP:

2>	perform the evaluation of reporting criteria as specified in 5.5.4.
5.5.3.2	Layer 3 filtering
The UE shall:
1>	for each cell measurement quantity and for each beam measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according to 5.5.3.1:
2>	filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:
	Fn = (1 – a)*Fn-1 + a*Mn
	where
Mn is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;
Fn is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;
Fn-1 is the old filtered measurement result, where F0 is set to M1 when the first measurement result from the physical layer is received; and a = 1/2(ki/4), where ki is the filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity of the i:th QuantityConfigNR in quantityConfigNR-List, and i is indicated by quantityConfigIndex in MeasObjectNR;
2>	adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are preserved at different input rates, observing that the filterCoefficient k assumes a sample rate equal to X ms; The value of X is equivalent to one intra-frequency L1 measurement period as defined in TS 38.133 [14] assuming non-DRX operation, and depends on frequency range.
NOTE 1:	If k is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
NOTE 2:	The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements.
NOTE 3:	The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the performance requirements set in TS 38.133 [14]. For further details about the physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 [14].
5.5.3.3	Derivation of cell measurement results
The network may configure the UE to derive RSRP, RSRQ and SINR measurement results per cell associated to NR measurement objects based on parameters configured in the measObject (e.g. maximum number of beams to be averaged and beam consolidation thresholds) and in the reportConfig (rsType to be measured, SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).
The UE shall:
1>	for each cell measurement quantity to be derived based on SS/PBCH block:
2>	if nrofSS-BlocksToAverage in the associated measObject is not configured; or
2>	if absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation in the associated measObject is not configured; or

5.5.6	Location measurement indication
5.5.6.1	General

Figure 5.5.5.1-1: Location measurement indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop location related measurements which require measurement gaps.
NOTE:	It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
5.5.6.2	Initiation
The UE shall:
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing location measurements and the UE requires measurement gaps for these measurements while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2>	initiate the procedure to indicate start;
NOTE 1:	The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the procedure in the same PCell once per frequency of the target RAT if the provided measurement gaps are insufficient.
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing location measurements:
2>	initiate the procedure to indicate stop.
NOTE 2:	The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it did not previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.

3>	set the measurementIndication to release;
1>	submit the LocationMeasurementIndication message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
5.6	UE capabilities
5.6.1	UE capability transfer
5.6.1.1	General
This clause describes how the UE compiles and transfers its UE capability information upon receiving a UECapabilityEnquiry from the network.

Figure 5.6.1.1-1: UE capability transfer
5.6.1.2	Initiation
The network initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs (additional) UE radio access capability information.
5.6.1.3	Reception of the UECapabilityEnquiry by the UE
The UE shall set the contents of UECapabilityInformation message as follows:
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to nr:
2>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-NR-Capability and with the rat-Type set to nr;
2>	include the supportedBandCombinationList, featureSets and featureSetCombinations as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to eutra-nr:
2> if the UE supports EN-DC:
3>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-MRDC-Capability and with the rat-Type set to eutra-nr;
3>	include the supportedBandCombinationList and featureSetCombinations as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to eutra:
2>	if the UE supports E-UTRA:
3>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a ue-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-EUTRA-Capability and with the rat-Type set to eutra as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3, according to the capabilityRequestFilter, if received;
1>	submit the UECapabilityInformation message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
5.6.1.4	Setting band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets supported by the UE
The UE invokes the procedures in this clause if the NR or E-UTRA network requests UE capabilities for nr, eutra-nr or eutra. This procedure is invoked once per requested rat-Type (see clause 5.6.1.3 for capability enquiry by the NR network; see TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3 for capability enquiry by the E-UTRA network). The UE shall ensure that the feature set IDs and feature set combination IDs are consistent across feature sets, feature set combinations and band combinations in all three UE capability containers that the network queries with the same frequencyBandListFilter and with the same eutra-nr-only flag (where applicable).
NOTE 1:	Capability enquiry without frequencyBandListFilter is not supported.
NOTE 2:	In EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types nr and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSets in the UE-NR-Capabilities together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capabilities to determine the NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Similarly, the eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types eutra and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSetsEUTRA-r15 in the UE-EUTRA-Capabilities together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capabilities to determine the E-UTRA UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used in the featureSets must match the IDs referred to in featureSetCombinations across all three containers. The requirement on consistency implies that there are no undefined feature sets and feature set combinations.
NOTE 3:	If the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set combinations due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation which feature sets and feature set combinations it prioritizes.
The UE shall:
1>	compile a list of "candidate band combinations" only consisting of bands included in frequencyBandListFilter, and prioritized in the order of frequencyBandListFilter (i.e. first include band combinations containing the first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the second-listed band, and so on), where for each band in the band combination, the parameters of the band do not exceed maxBandwidthRequestedDL, maxBandwidthRequestedUL, maxCarriersRequestedDL, maxCarriersRequestedUL, ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA or ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;
1>	for each band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations":
2>	if the network (E-UTRA) included the eutra-nr-only field, or
2>	if the requested rat-Type is eutra:
3>	remove the NR-only band combination from the list of "candidate band combinations";
NOTE 4:	The (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for nr but indicate with the eutra-nr-only flag that the UE shall not include any NR band combinations in the UE-NR-Capabilities. In this case the procedural text above removes all NR-only band combinations from the candidate list and thereby also avoids inclusion of corresponding feature set combinations and feature sets below.
2>	if it is regarded as a fallback band combination with the same capabilities of another band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations":
3>	remove the band combination from the list of "candidate band combinations";
NOTE 5:	Even if the network requests (only) capabilities for nr, it may include E-UTRA band numbers in the frequencyBandListFilter to ensure that the UE includes all necessary feature sets needed for subsequently requested eutra-nr capabilities. At this point of the procedure the list of "candidate band combinations" contains all NR- and/or E-UTRA-NR band combinations that match the filter (frequencyBandListFilter) provided by the NW and that match the eutra-nr-flag (if RAT-Type nr is requested by E-UTRA). In the following, this candidate list is used to derive the band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets to be reported in the requested capability container.
1>	if the requested rat-Type is nr:
2>	include into supportedBandCombinationList as many NR-only band combinations as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;
3>	if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
4>	if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5>	include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR for each band combination;
4>	set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
2>	include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList according to the previous;
2>	compile a list of "candidate feature set combinations" referenced from the list of "candidate band combinations" excluding entries (rows in feature set combinations) for fallback band combinations with same or lower capabilities;
NOTE 6:	This list of "candidate feature set combinations" contains the feature set combinations used for NR-only as well as E-UTRA-NR band combinations. It is used to derive a list of NR feature sets referred to from the feature set combinations in the UE-NR-Capabilities and from the feature set combinations in a UE-MRDC-Capabilities container.
2>	include into featureSets the feature sets referenced from the "candidate feature set combinations" excluding entries (feature sets per CC) for fallback band combinations with same or lower capabilities and may exclude the feature sets with the parameters that exceed any of maxBandwidthRequestedDL, maxBandwidthRequestedUL, maxCarriersRequestedDL or maxCarriersRequestedUL, whichever are received;
1>	else, if the requested rat-Type is eutra-nr:
2>	include into supportedBandCombinationList as many E-UTRA-NR band combinations as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;
3>	if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
4>	if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5>	include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR and srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA for each band combination;
4>	set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
2>	include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList according to the previous;
1>	else (if the requested rat-Type is eutra):
2>	compile a list of "candidate feature set combinations" referenced from the list of "candidate band combinations" excluding entries (rows in feature set combinations) for fallback band combinations with same or lower capabilities; 
NOTE 7:	This list of "candidate feature set combinations" contains the feature set combinations used for E-UTRA-NR band combinations. It is used to derive a list of E-UTRA feature sets referred to from the feature set combinations in a UE-MRDC-Capabilities container.
2>	include into featureSetsEUTRA the feature sets referenced from the "candidate feature set combinations" excluding entries (feature sets per CC) for fallback band combinations with same or lower capabilities and where the parameters do not exceed ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA and ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;
1>	include the received frequencyBandListFilter in the field appliedFreqBandListFilter of the requested UE capability;

6	Protocol data units, formats and parameters (ASN.1)
6.1	General
6.1.1	Introduction
The contents of each RRC message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in sub-clause 6.3.
6.1.2	Need codes and conditions for optional downlink fields
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1.
If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the message or information element specifying the need of the field for each condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases the value in case the field is not present. The conditions clarify what the UE may expect regarding the setting of the message by the network. Violation of conditions is regarded as invalid network behaviour, which the UE is not required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined in 10.4 does not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory according to the CondC or CondM condition.
For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and A.7.
Table 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to be present
Abbreviation
Meaning
Cond conditionTag
Conditionally present
Presence of the field is specified in a tabular form following the ASN.1 segment.
CondC conditionTag
Configuration condition
Presence of the field is conditional to other configuration settings.
CondM conditionTag
Message condition
Presence of the field is conditional to other fields included in the message.
Need S
Specified
Used for (configuration) fields, whose field description or procedure specifies the UE behavior performed upon receiving a message with the field absent (and not if field description or procedure specifies the UE behavior when field is not configured).
Need M
Maintain
Used for (configuration) fields that are stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon receiving a message with the field absent, the UE maintains the current value.
Need N
No action (one-shot configuration that is not maintained)
Used for (configuration) fields that are not stored and whose presence causes a one-time action by the UE. Upon receiving message with the field absent, the UE takes no action.
Need R
Release
Used for (configuration) fields that are stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon receiving a message with the field absent, the UE releases the current value.
NOTE:	In this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and CondM are not used.
Any field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be interpreted as Need R.
For downlink messages, the need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present. Thus, if the parent is absent the UE shall not release the field unless the absence of the parent field implies that. 
For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink messages, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each child field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend on the specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink messages without need codes where this rule applies are:
-	nonCriticalExtension fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE extension mechanism,
-	groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as extension groups), and
-	non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.

    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
-	if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE does not modify any child fields configured within field1 (regardless of their need codes);
-	if field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE releases the field2 (and also its child field field21);
-	if field1 or field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is present, UE retains or releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions;
-	if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is present but the extension group containing field13 and field14 is absent, the UE releases field13 but does not modify field14;
-	if nonCriticalExtension defined by IE RRCMessage-v1570-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field3 but releases field4;

MIB field descriptions
cellBarred
Barred means the cell is barred, as defined in TS 38.304 [20].
dmrs-TypeA-Position
Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.1.2) and uplink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
intraFreqReselection
Controls cell selection/reselection to intra-frequency cells when the highest ranked cell is barred, or treated as barred by the UE, as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
pdcch-ConfigSIB1
Determines a common ControlResourceSet (CORESET), a common search space and necessary PDCCH parameters. If the field ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is not present, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 indicates the frequency positions where the UE may find SS/PBCH block with SIB1 or the frequency range where the network does not provide SS/PBCH block with SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).
ssb-SubcarrierOffset
Corresponds to kSSB (see TS 38.213 [13]), which is the frequency domain offset between SSB and the overall resource block grid in number of subcarriers. (See TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.3.1).
The value range of this field may be extended by an additional most significant bit encoded within PBCH as specified in TS 38.213 [13].
This field may indicate that this cell does not provide SIB1 and that there is hence no CORESET#0 configured in MIB (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). In this case, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 may indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).
subCarrierSpacingCommon
Subcarrier spacing for SIB1, Msg.2/4 for initial access, paging and broadcast SI-messages. If the UE acquires this MIB on a carrier frequency <6 GHz, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 15 kHz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 30 kHz. If the UE acquires this MIB on a carrier frequency >6 GHz, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 60 kHz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 120 kHz.
systemFrameNumber
The 6 most significant bits (MSB) of the 10-bit System Frame Number (SFN). The 4 LSB of the SFN are conveyed in the PBCH transport block as part of channel coding (i.e. outside the MIB encoding), as defined in clause 7.1 in TS 38.212 [17].

This field is used to transfer SIB6, SIB7, SIB8 to the UE.
fullConfig
Indicates that the full configuration option is applicable for the RRCReconfiguration message.
keySetChangeIndicator
True is used in an intra-cell handover when a KgNB key is derived from a KAMF key taken into use through the latest successful NAS SMC procedure, or N2 handover procedure with KAMF change, as described in TS 33.501 [11] for KgNB re-keying. False is used in an intra-NR handover when the new KgNB key is obtained from the current KgNB key or from the NH as described in TS 33.501 [11].
masterCellGroup
Configuration of master cell group.
nas-Container
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for this field, although it affects activation of AS  security after inter-system handover to NR. The content is defined in TS 24.501 [23].
nextHopChainingCount
Parameter NCC: See TS 33.501 [11]
otherConfig
Contains configuration related to other configurations.
radioBearerConfig
Configuration of Radio Bearers (DRBs, SRBs) including SDAP/PDCP. In EN-DC this field may only be present if the RRCReconfiguration is transmitted over SRB3.
secondaryCellGroup
Configuration of secondary cell group (EN-DC).

Conditional Presence
Explanation
nonHO
The field is not present in case of reconfiguration with sync within NR or to NR; otherwise it is optionally present, need N.
securityNASC
This field is mandatory present in case of inter system handover. Otherwise the field is optionally present, need N.
MasterKeyChange
This field is mandatory present in case of Handover with change of the AS security algorithms (as indicated in SecurityAlgorithmConfig in SecurityConfig, included in the received RadioBearerConfig). If ReconfigurationWithSync is included for other cases, this field is optionally present, need N. Otherwise the field is absent.
FullConfig
The field is mandatory present in case of inter-system handover from E-UTRA/EPC to NR. It is optionally present, Need N, during reconfiguration with sync and also in first reconfiguration after reestablishment; or for intra-system handover from E-UTRA/5GC to NR. It is not present otherwise.

dayLightSavingTime
Indicates if and how daylight-saving time (DST) is applied to obtain the local time. The semantics are the same as the semantics of the Daylight Saving Time IE in TS 24.501 [23] and TS 24.008 [38]. The first/leftmost bit of the bit string contains the b2 of octet 3 and the second bit of the bit string contains b1 of octet 3 in the value part of the Daylight Saving Time IE in TS 24.008 [38].
leapSeconds
Number of leap seconds offset between GPS Time and UTC. UTC and GPS time are related i.e. GPS time -leapSeconds = UTC time.
localTimeOffset
Offset between UTC and local time in units of 15 minutes. Actual value = field value * 15 minutes. Local time of the day is calculated as UTC time + localTimeOffset.
timeInfoUTC
Coordinated Universal Time corresponding to the SFN boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the SI-window in which SIB9 is transmitted. The field counts the number of UTC seconds in 10 ms units since 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 (midnight between Sunday, December 31, 1899 and Monday, January 1, 1900). See NOTE 1.

Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure configuredGrantConfig when there is an active configured uplink grant Type 2 (see TS 38.321 [3]). However, the NW may release the configuredGrantConfig at any time.
pucch-Config
PUCCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL, the network configures PUCCH only on the BWPs of one of the uplinks (normal UL or SUL). The network configures PUCCH-Config at least on non-initial BWP(s) for SpCell and PUCCH SCell. If supported by the UE, the network may configure at most one additional SCell of a cell group with PUCCH-Config (i.e. PUCCH SCell).
In EN-DC, The NW configures at most one serving cell per frequency range with PUCCH. And in EN-DC, if two PUCCH groups are configured, the serving cells of the NR PUCCH group in FR2 use the same numerology.
The NW may configure PUCCH for a BWP when setting up the BWP. The network may also add/remove the pucch-Config in an RRCReconfiguraiton with reconfigurationWithSync to move the PUCCH between the UL and SUL carrier of one serving. In other cases, only modifications of a previously configured pucch-Config are allowed.
If one (S)UL BWP of a serving cell is configured with PUCCH, all other (S)UL BWPs must be configured with PUCCH, too.
pusch-Config
PUSCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL and if it has a PUSCH-Config for both UL and SUL, a carrier indicator field in DCI indicates for which of the two to use an UL grant. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.
srs-Config
Uplink sounding reference signal configuration.

ReconfigurationWithSync field descriptions
rach-ConfigDedicated
Random access configuration to be used for the reconfiguration with sync (e.g. handover). The UE performs the RA according to these parameters in the firstActiveUplinkBWP (see UplinkConfig).
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell change and intra-NR handover. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in spCellConfigCommon. For case of intra-NR handover, the smtc is based on the timing reference of source PCell. For case of NR PSCell change, it is based on the timing reference of source PSCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing.

SCellConfig field descriptions
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR SCell addition. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in sCellConfigCommon. The smtc is based on the timing of the SpCell of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is the target SpCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing.

SpCellConfig field descriptions
reconfigurationWithSync
Parameters for the synchronous reconfiguration to the target SpCell.
rlf-TimersAndConstants
Timers and constants for detecting and triggering cell-level radio link failure. For the SCG, rlf-TimersAndConstants can only be set to setup and is always included at SCG addition.
servCellIndex
Serving cell ID of a PSCell. The PCell of the Master Cell Group uses ID = 0.

powerControlLoopToUse
Closed control loop to apply (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1.1).
rbg-Size
Selection between configuration 1 and configuration 2 for RBG size for PUSCH. The UE does not apply this field if resourceAllocation is set to resourceAllocationType1. Otherwise, the UE applies the value config1 when the field is absent. Note: rbg-Size is used when the transformPrecoder parameter is disabled.
repK-RV
The redundancy version (RV) sequence to use. See TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2. The network configures this field if repetitions are used, i.e., if repK is set to n2, n4 or n8. Otherwise, the field is absent.
repK
The number of repetitions of K.
resourceAllocation
Configuration of resource allocation type 0 and resource allocation type 1. For Type 1 UL data transmission without grant, "resourceAllocation" should be resourceAllocationType0 or resourceAllocationType1.
rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant
Configuration for "configured grant" transmission with fully RRC-configured UL grant (Type1). If this field is absent the UE uses UL grant configured by DCI addressed to CS-RNTI (Type2). Type 1 configured grant may be configured for UL or SUL, but not for both simultaneously.
srs-ResourceIndicator
Indicates the SRS resource to be used. 
timeDomainAllocation
Indicates a combination of start symbol and length and PUSCH mapping type, see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2 and TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1.
timeDomainOffset
Offset related to SFN=0, see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.8.2.
transformPrecoder
Enables or disables transform precoding for type1 and type2. If the field is absent, the UE enables or disables transform precoding in accordance with the field msg3-transformPrecoder in RACH-ConfigCommon, see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.3.
uci-OnPUSCH
Selection between and configuration of dynamic and semi-static beta-offset. For Type 1 UL data transmission without grant, uci-OnPUSCH should be set to semiStatic.

cce-REG-MappingType
Mapping of Control Channel Elements (CCE) to Resource Element Groups (REG) (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
controlResourceSetId
Value 0 identifies the common CORESET configured in MIB and in ServingCellConfigCommon (controlResourceSetZero) and is hence not used here in the ControlResourceSet IE. Values 1..maxNrofControlResourceSets-1 identify CORESETs configured by dedicated signalling or in SIB1. The controlResourceSetId is unique among the BWPs of a serving cell.
duration
Contiguous time duration of the CORESET in number of symbols (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
frequencyDomainResources
Frequency domain resources for the CORESET. Each bit corresponds a group of 6 RBs, with grouping starting from the first RB group (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1) in the BWP. The first (left-most / most significant) bit corresponds to the first RB group in the BWP, and so on. A bit that is set to 1 indicates that this RB group belongs to the frequency domain resource of this CORESET. Bits corresponding to a group of RBs not fully contained in the bandwidth part within which the CORESET is configured are set to zero (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
interleaverSize
Interleaver-size (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID
PDCCH DMRS scrambling initialization (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.3.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCellId configured for this serving cell.
precoderGranularity
Precoder granularity in frequency domain (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
reg-BundleSize
Resource Element Groups (REGs) can be bundled to create REG bundles. This parameter defines the size of such bundles (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
shiftIndex
When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCellIdconfigured for this serving cell (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
tci-PresentInDCI
If at least spatial QCL is configured/indicated, this field indicates if TCI field is present or not present in DL-related DCI. When the field is absent the UE considers the TCI to be absent/disabled. In case of cross carrier scheduling, the network sets this field to enabled for the ControlResourceSet used for cross carrier scheduling in the scheduling cell (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5).
tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList
A subset of the TCI states defined in pdsch-Config included in the BWP-DownlinkDedicated corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the ControlResourceSet belong to. They are used for providing QCL relationships between the DL RS(s) in one RS Set (TCI-State) and the PDCCH DMRS ports (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6.). The network configures at most maxNrofTCI-StatesPDCCH entries.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
NotSIB1-initialBWP
The field is absent in SIB1 and in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP in ServingCellConfigCommon, if SIB1 is broadcasted. Otherwise, it is optionally present, Need N.

–	ControlResourceSetId
The ControlResourceSetId IE concerns a short identity, used to identify a control resource set within a serving cell. The ControlResourceSetId = 0 identifies the ControlResourceSet#0 configured via PBCH (MIB) and in controlResourceSetZero (ServingCellConfigCommon). The ID space is used across the BWPs of a Serving Cell. The number of CORESETs per BWP is limited to 3 (including common and UE-specific CORESETs).

CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig field descriptions
cif-Presence
The field is used to indicate whether carrier indicator field is present (value true) or not (value false) in PDCCH DCI formats, see TS 38.213 [13]. 
cif-InSchedulingCell
The field indicates the CIF value used in the scheduling cell to indicate a grant or assignment applicable for this cell, see TS 38.213 [13]. If cif-Presence is set to true, the CIF value indicating a grant or assignment for this cell is 0.
other
Parameters for cross-carrier scheduling, i.e., a serving cell is scheduled by a PDCCH on another (scheduling) cell. The network configures this field only for SCells.
own
Parameters for self-scheduling, i.e., a serving cell is scheduled by its own PDCCH.
schedulingCellId
Indicates which cell signals the downlink allocations and uplink grants, if applicable, for the concerned SCell. In case the UE is configured with DC, the scheduling cell is part of the same cell group (i.e. MCG or SCG) as the scheduled cell.

–	CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList
The CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList IE is used to configure the UE with a list of aperiodic trigger states. Each codepoint of the DCI field "CSI request" is associated with one trigger state (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 6.1.3.13). Upon reception of the value associated with a trigger state, the UE will perform measurement of CSI-RS, CSI-IM and/or SSB (reference signals) and aperiodic reporting on L1 according to all entries in the associatedReportConfigInfoList for that trigger state.

csi-ReportingBand
Indicates a contiguous or non-contiguous subset of subbands in the bandwidth part which CSI shall be reported for. Each bit in the bit-string represents one subband. The right-most bit in the bit string represents the lowest subband in the BWP. The choice determines the number of subbands (subbands3 for 3 subbands, subbands4 for 4 subbands, and so on) (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). This field is absent if there are less than 24 PRBs (no sub band) and present otherwise, the number of sub bands can be from 3 (24 PRBs, sub band size 8) to 18 (72 PRBs, sub band size 4).
dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
groupBasedBeamReporting
Turning on/off group beam based reporting (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
non-PMI-PortIndication
Port indication for RI/CQI calculation. For each CSI-RS resource in the linked ResourceConfig for channel measurement, a port indication for each rank R, indicating which R ports to use. Applicable only for non-PMI feedback (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2).
The first entry in non-PMI-PortIndication corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the CSI-ResourceConfig whose CSI-ResourceConfigId is indicated in a CSI-MeasId together with the above CSI-ReportConfigId; the second entry in non-PMI-PortIndication corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig, and so on until the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the last entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig. Then the next entry corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the second entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig and so on.
nrofReportedRS
The number (N) of measured RS resources to be reported per report setting in a non-group-based report. N <= N_max, where N_max is either 2 or 4 depending on UE capability.
(see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4) When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference
NZP CSI RS resources for interference measurement. csi-ResourceConfigId of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field "carrier" above. The CSI-ResourceConfig indicated here contains only NZP-CSI-RS resources. The bwp-Id in that CSI-ResourceConfig is the same value as the bwp-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement.
p0alpha
Index of the p0-alpha set determining the power control for this CSI report transmission (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1.2).
pdsch-BundleSizeForCSI
PRB bundling size to assume for CQI calculation when reportQuantity is CRI/RI/i1/CQI. If the field is absent, the UE assumes that no PRB bundling is applied (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2).
pmi-FormatIndicator
Indicates whether the UE shall report a single (wideband) or multiple (subband) PMI. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
pucch-CSI-ResourceList
Indicates which PUCCH resource to use for reporting on PUCCH.
reportConfigType
Time domain behavior of reporting configuration.
reportFreqConfiguration
Reporting configuration in the frequency domain. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
reportQuantity
The CSI related quantities to report. see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.
reportSlotConfig
Periodicity and slot offset (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). If the field reportSlotConfig-v1530 is present, the UE shall ignore the value provided in reportSlotConfig (without suffix).
reportSlotOffsetList
Timing offset Y for semi persistent reporting using PUSCH. This field lists the allowed offset values. This list must have the same number of entries as the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationList in PUSCH-Config. A particular value is indicated in DCI. The network indicates in the DCI field of the UL grant, which of the configured report slot offsets the UE shall apply. The DCI value 0 corresponds to the first report slot offset in this list, the DCI value 1 corresponds to the second report slot offset in this list, and so on. The first report is transmitted in slot n+Y, second report in n+Y+P, where P is the configured periodicity.
Timing offset Y for aperiodic reporting using PUSCH. This field lists the allowed offset values. This list must have the same number of entries as the pusch-TimeDomainAllocationList in PUSCH-Config. A particular value is indicated in DCI. The network indicates in the DCI field of the UL grant, which of the configured report slot offsets the UE shall apply. The DCI value 0 corresponds to the first report slot offset in this list, the DCI value 1 corresponds to the second report slot offset in this list, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.3). 
resourcesForChannelMeasurement
Resources for channel measurement. csi-ResourceConfigId of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field "carrier" above. The CSI-ResourceConfig indicated here contains only NZP-CSI-RS resources and/or SSB resources. This CSI-ReportConfig is associated with the DL BWP indicated by bwp-Id in that CSI-ResourceConfig.
subbandSize
Indicates one out of two possible BWP-dependent values for the subband size as indicated in TS 38.214 [19], table 5.2.1.4-2 . If csi-ReportingBand is absent, the UE shall ignore this field.
timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements
Time domain measurement restriction for the channel (signal) measurements (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.1).
timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements
Time domain measurement restriction for interference measurements (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.1).

DMRS-UplinkConfig field descriptions
dmrs-AdditionalPosition
Position for additional DM-RS in UL (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3). If the field is absent, the UE applies the value pos2. See also clause 6.4.1.1.3 for additional constraints on how the network may set this field depending on the setting of other fields.
dmrs-Type
Selection of the DMRS type to be used for UL (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3) If the field is absent, the UE uses DMRS type 1.
maxLength
The maximum number of OFDM symbols for UL front loaded DMRS. len1 corresponds to value 1. len2 corresponds to value 2. If the field is absent, the UE applies value len1. If set to len2, the UE determines the actual number of DM-RS symbols by the associated DCI. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
nPUSCH-Identity
Parameter: N_ID^(PUSCH) for DFT-s-OFDM DMRS. If the value is absent or released, the UE uses the value Physical cell ID (physCellId). See TS 38.211 [16].
phaseTrackingRS
Configures uplink PTRS (see TS 38.211 [16]).
scramblingID0
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1) When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId).
scramblingID1
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1) When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId).
sequenceGroupHopping
For DMRS transmission with transform precoder the NW may configure group hopping by the cell-specific parameter groupHoppingEnabledTransformPrecoding in PUSCH-ConfigCommon. In this case, the NW may include this UE specific field to disable group hopping for PUSCH transmission except for Msg3, i.e., to override the configuration in PUSCH-ConfigCommon (see TS 38.211 [16]). If the field is absent, the UE uses the same hopping mode as for Msg3.
sequenceHopping
Determines if sequence hopping is enabled for DMRS transmission with transform precoder for PUSCH transmission other than Msg3 (sequence hopping is always disabled for Msg3). If the field is absent, the UE uses the same hopping mode as for msg3. The network does not configure simultaneous group hopping and sequence hopping. See TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.2.
transformPrecodingDisabled
DMRS related parameters for Cyclic Prefix OFDM.
transformPrecodingEnabled
DMRS related parameters for DFT-s-OFDM (Transform Precoding).

measPRS-Offset
Indicates the requested gap offset for performing RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA. It is the smallest subframe offset from the beginning of subframe 0 of SFN=0 of the serving cell of the requested gap for measuring PRS positioning occasions in the carrier frequency carrierFreq for which the UE needs to perform the inter-RAT RSTD measurements. The PRS positioning occasion information is received from upper layers.

The parameter is used only when an SCell is configured on the frequency indicated by the measObjectNR and is in deactivated state, see TS 38.133 [14]. gNB configures the parameter whenever an SCell is configured on the frequency indicated by the measObjectNR, but the field may also be signalled when an SCell is not configured. Value sf160 corresponds to 160 sub-frames, value sf256 corresponds to 256 sub-frames and so on.
nrofCSInrofCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage
Indicates the maximum number of measurement results per beam based on CSI-RS resources to be averaged. The same value applies for each detected cell associated with this MeasObjectNR.
nrofSS-BlocksToAverage
Indicates the maximum number of measurement results per beam based on SS/PBCH blocks to be averaged. The same value applies for each detected cell associated with this MeasObject.
offsetMO
Offset values applicable to all measured cells with reference signal(s) indicated in this MeasObjectNR.
quantityConfigIndex
Indicates the n-th element of quantityConfigNR-List provided in MeasConfig.
referenceSignalConfig
RS configuration for SS/PBCH block and CSI-RS.
refFreqCSI-RS
Point A which is used for mapping of CSI-RS to physical resources according to TS 38.211 [16] clause 7.4.1.5.3.
smtc1
Primary measurement timing configuration. (see clause 5.5.2.10).
smtc2
Secondary measurement timing configuration for SS corresponding to this MeasObjectNR with PCI listed in pci-List. For these SS, the periodicity is indicated by periodicity in smtc2 and the timing offset is equal to the offset indicated in periodicityAndOffset modulo periodicity. periodicity in smtc2 can only be set to a value strictly shorter than the periodicity indicated by periodicityAndOffset in smtc1 (e.g. if periodicityAndOffset indicates sf10, periodicity can only be set of sf5, if periodicityAndOffset indicates sf5, smtc2 cannot be configured).
ssbFrequency
Indicates the frequency of the SS associated to this MeasObjectNR.
ssbSubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of SSB. Only the values 15 kHz or 30 kHz (<6GHz), 120 kHz or 240 kHz (>6GHz) are applicable.
whiteCellsToAddModList
List of cells to add/modify in the white list of cells. It applies only to SSB resources.
whiteCellsToRemoveList
List of cells to remove from the white list of cells.

ReferenceSignalConfig field descriptions
csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility
CSI-RS resources to be used for CSI-RS based RRM measurements.
ssb-ConfigMobility
SSB configuration for mobility (nominal SSBs, timing configuration).

SSB-ConfigMobility field descriptions
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell
If this field is set to true, UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the same frequency carrier as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. Hence, if the UE is configured with a serving cell for which (absoluteFrequencySSB, subcarrierSpacing) in ServingCellConfigCommon is equal to (ssbFrequency, ssbSubcarrierSpacing) in this MeasObjectNR, this field indicates whether the UE can utilize the timing of this serving cell to derive the index of SS block transmitted by neighbour cell. Otherwise, this field indicates whether the UE may use the timing of any detected cell on that target frequency to derive the SSB index of all neighbour cells on that frequency.
ssb-ToMeasure
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0, the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the UE measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS/PBCH blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
CSI-RS
This field is mandatory present if csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility is configured, otherwise, it is absent.
SSBorAssociatedSSB
This field is mandatory present if ssb-ConfigMobility is configured or associatedSSB is configured in at least one cell, otherwise, it is absent and the UE releases a previously configured value.
IntraFreqConnected
This field is optionally present, Need R if the UE is configured with a serving cell for which (absoluteFrequencySSB, subcarrierSpacing) in ServingCellConfigCommon is equal to (ssbFrequency, ssbSubcarrierSpacing) in this MeasObjectNR, otherwise, it is absent.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
InitialBWP-Only
If SIB1 is broadcast the field is mandatory present in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in ServingCellConfigCommon; it is absent in other BWPs and when sent in system information. If SIB1 is not broadcast and there is an SSB associated to the cell, the field is optionally present, Need M, in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in ServingCellConfigCommon (still with the same setting for all UEs). In other cases, the field is absent.
OtherBWP
This field is optionally present, Need R, if this BWP is not the initial DL BWP and pagingSearchSpace is configured in this BWP. Otherwise this field is not present.

PDCP-Config field descriptions
cipheringDisabled
If included, ciphering is disabled for this DRB regardless of which ciphering algorithm is configured for the SRB/DRBs. The field may only be included if the UE is connected to 5GC. Otherwise the field is absent. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
discardTimer
Value in ms of discardTimer specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms50 corresponds to 50 ms, value ms100 corresponds to 100 ms and so on.
drb-ContinueROHC
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the ROHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. This field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
headerCompression
If rohc is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in both uplink and downlink. If uplinkOnlyROHC is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in uplink (there is no header compression in downlink). ROHC can be configured for any bearer type. The network reconfigures headerCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment.  Network configures headerCompression to notUsed when outOfOrderDelivery is configured.
integrityProtection
Indicates whether or not integrity protection is configured for this radio bearer. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
maxCID
Indicates the value of the MAX_CID parameter as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
The total value of MAX_CIDs across all bearers for the UE should be less than or equal to the value of maxNumberROHC-ContextSessions parameter as indicated by the UE. The network configures the same value for maxCID in both rohc and uplinkOnlyROHC.
moreThanOneRLC
This field configures UL data transmission when more than one RLC entity is associated with the PDCP entity.
outOfOrderDelivery
Indicates whether or not outOfOrderDelivery specified in TS 38.323 [5] is configured. This field should be either always present or always absent, since the radio bearer is established.
pdcp-Duplication
Indicates whether or not uplink duplication status at the time of receiving this IE is configured and activated as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The presence of this field indicates whether duplication is configured. PDCP duplication is not configured for CA packet duplication of LTE RLC bearer. The value of this field, when the field is present, indicates the initial state of the duplication. If set to true, duplication is activated. The value of this field is always true, when configured for a SRB.
pdcp-SN-SizeDL
PDCP sequence number size for downlink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len12bits is applicable.
pdcp-SN-SizeUL
PDCP sequence number size for uplink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len12bits is applicable.
primaryPath
Indicates the cell group ID and LCID of the primary RLC entity as specified in TS 38.323 [5], clause 5.2.1 for UL data transmission when more than one RLC entity is associated with the PDCP entity. In this version of the specification, only cell group ID corresponding to MCG is supported for SRBs. The NW indicates cellGroup for split bearers using logical channels in different cell groups. The NW indicates logicalChannel for CA based PDCP duplication, i.e., if both logical channels terminate in the same cell group.
statusReportRequired
For AM DRBs, indicates whether the DRB is configured to send a PDCP status report in the uplink, as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
t-Reordering
Value in ms of t-Reordering specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms0 corresponds to 0 ms, value ms20 corresponds to 20 ms, value ms40 corresponds to 40 ms, and so on.  When the field is absent the UE applies the value infinity.
ul-DataSplitThreshold
Parameter specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value b0 corresponds to 0 bytes, value b100 corresponds to 100 bytes, value b200 corresponds to 200 bytes, and so on. The network sets this field to 'infinity' for UEs not supporting splitDRB-withUL-Both-MCG-SCG. If the field is absent when the split bearer is configured for the radio bearer first time, then the default value infinity is applied.

Conditional presence
Explanation
DRB
This field is mandatory present when the corresponding DRB is being set up, not present for SRBs. Otherwise this field is optionally present, need M.
MoreThanOneRLC
This field is mandatory present upon RRC reconfiguration with setup of a PDCP entity for a radio bearer with more than one associated logical channel and upon RRC reconfiguration with the association of an additional logical channel to the PDCP entity.
Upon RRC reconfiguration when a PDCP entity is associated with multiple logical channels, this field is optionally present need M. Otherwise, this field is absent, and all its included parameters are released.
Rlc-AM
For RLC AM, the field is optionally present, need R. Otherwise, the field is not present.
Setup
The field is mandatory present in case of radio bearer setup. Otherwise the field is optionally present, need M.
SplitBearer
The field is absent for SRBs. Otherwise, the field is optional present, need M, in case of radio bearer with more than one associated RLC mapped to different cell groups.
ConnectedTo5GC
The field is optionally present, need R, if the UE is connected to 5GC. Otherwise the field is absent.
ConnectedTo5GC1
The field is optionally present, need R, if the UE is connected to NR/5GC. Otherwise the field is absent.
Setup2
This field is mandatory present in case for radio bearer setup for RLC-AM and RLC-UM. Otherwise, this field is not present.

PDSCH-Config field descriptions
aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList
AddMod/Release lists for configuring aperiodically triggered zero-power CSI-RS resource sets. Each set contains a ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId and the IDs of one or more ZP-CSI-RS-Resources (the actual resources are defined in the zp-CSI-RS-ResourceToAddModList). The network configures the UE with at most 3 aperiodic ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSets and it uses only the ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId 1 to 3. The network triggers a set by indicating its ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId in the DCI payload. The DCI codepoint '01' triggers the resource set with ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId 1, the DCI codepoint '10' triggers the resource set with ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId 2, and the DCI codepoint '11' triggers the resource set with ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId 3 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.2)
dataScramblingIdentityPDSCH
Identifier used to initialize data scrambling (c_init) for PDSCH. If the field is absent, the UE applies the physical cell ID. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.1.1).
dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA
DMRS configuration for PDSCH transmissions using PDSCH mapping type A (chosen dynamically via PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation). Only the fields dmrs-Type, dmrs-AdditionalPosition and maxLength may be set differently for mapping type A and B.
dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB
DMRS configuration for PDSCH transmissions using PDSCH mapping type B (chosen dynamically via PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation). Only the fields dmrs-Type, dmrs-AdditionalPosition and maxLength may be set differently for mapping type A and B.
maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI
Maximum number of code words that a single DCI may schedule. This changes the number of MCS/RV/NDI bits in the DCI message from 1 to 2.
mcs-Table
Indicates which MCS table the UE shall use for PDSCH. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.3.1). If the field is absent the UE applies the value 64QAM.
pdsch-AggregationFactor
Number of repetitions for data (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList
List of time-domain configurations for timing of DL assignment to DL data (see table 5.1.2.1.1-1 in TS 38.214 [19]).
prb-BundlingType
Indicates the PRB bundle type and bundle size(s) (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.3). If dynamic is chosen, the actual bundleSizeSet1 or bundleSizeSet2 to use is indicated via DCI. Constraints on bundleSize(Set) setting depending on vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver and rbg-Size settings are described in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.3. If a bundleSize(Set) value is absent, the UE applies the value n2. 
p-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet
A set of periodically occurring ZP-CSI-RS-Resources (the actual resources are defined in the zp-CSI-RS-ResourceToAddModList). The network uses the ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId=0 for this set.
rateMatchPatternGroup1
The IDs of a first group of RateMatchPatterns defined in PDSCH-Config->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (BWP level) or in ServingCellConfig ->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (cell level). These patterns can be activated dynamically by DCI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
rateMatchPatternGroup2
The IDs of a second group of RateMatchPatterns defined in PDSCH-Config->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (BWP level) or in ServingCellConfig ->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (cell level). These patterns can be activated dynamically by DCI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
rateMatchPatternToAddModList
Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around. The UE rate matches around the union of all resources indicated in the nested bitmaps (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). FFS: RAN1 indicates that there should be a set of patterns per cell and one per BWP => Having both seems unnecessary.
rbg-Size

format
Selection of the PUCCH format (format 0 – 4) and format-specific parameters, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2. format0 and format1 are only allowed for a resource in a first PUCCH resource set. format2, format3 and format4 are only allowed for a resource in non-first PUCCH resource set.
intraSlotFrequencyHopping
Enabling intra-slot frequency hopping, applicable for all types of PUCCH formats. For long PUCCH over multiple slots, the intra and inter slot frequency hopping cannot be enabled at the same time for a UE. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1.
pucch-ResourceId
Identifier of the PUCCH resource.
secondHopPRB
Index of first PRB after frequency hopping (for second hop) of PUCCH. This value is applicable for intra-slot frequency hopping. See TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1.

PUCCH-ResourceSet field descriptions
maxPayloadMinus1
Maximum number of payload bits minus 1 that the UE may transmit using this PUCCH resource set. In a PUCCH occurrence, the UE chooses the first of its PUCCH-ResourceSet which supports the number of bits that the UE wants to transmit. The field is not present in the first set (Set0) since the maximum Size of Set0 is specified to be 3 bits. The field is not present in the last configured set since the UE derives its maximum payload size as specified in TS 38.213 [13]. This field can take integer values that are multiples of 4 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2).
resourceList
PUCCH resources of format0 and format1 are only allowed in the first PUCCH resource set, i.e., in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSetId = 0. This set may contain between 1 and 32 resources. PUCCH resources of format2, format3 and format4 are only allowed in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSetId > 0. If present, these sets contain between 1 and 8 resources each. The UE chooses a PUCCH-Resource from this list as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3. Note that this list contains only a list of resource IDs. The actual resources are configured in PUCCH-Config.

RACH-ConfigCommon field descriptions
messagePowerOffsetGroupB
Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to –infinity. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB5 corresponds to 5 dB and so on. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2)
msg1-SubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of PRACH (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2). Only the values 15 or 30 kHz (<6GHz), 60 or 120 kHz (>6GHz) are applicable. If absent, the UE applies the SCS as derived from the prach-ConfigurationIndex in RACH-ConfigGeneric (see tables Table 6.3.3.1-1 and Table 6.3.3.2-2, TS 38.211 [16]). The value also applies to contention free random access (RACH-ConfigDedicated), to SI-request and to contention-based beam failure recovery (CB-BFR). But it does not apply for contention free beam failure recovery (CF-BFR) (see BeamFailureRecoveryConfig).
msg3-transformPrecoder
Enables the transform precoder for Msg3 transmission according to clause 6.1.3 of TS 38.214 [19]. If the field is absent, the UE disables the transformer precoder (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.3).
numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA
The number of CB preambles per SSB in group A. This determines implicitly the number of CB preambles per SSB available in group B. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB.
prach-RootSequenceIndex
PRACH root sequence index (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1). The value range depends on whether L=839 or L=139. The short/long preamble format indicated in this IE should be consistent with the one indicated in prach-ConfigurationIndex in the RACH-ConfigDedicated (if configured).
ra-ContentionResolutionTimer
The initial value for the contention resolution timer (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.5). Value sf8 corresponds to 8 subframes, value sf16 corresponds to 16 subframes, and so on.
ra-Msg3SizeGroupA
Transport Blocks size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2).
rach-ConfigGeneric
RACH parameters for both regular random access and beam failure recovery.
restrictedSetConfig
Configuration of an unrestricted set or one of two types of restricted sets, see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1.
rsrp-ThresholdSSB
UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).
rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL
The UE selects SUL carrier to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The value applies to all the BWPs.
ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB
The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEight corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value n4 corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value n8 corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB * max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). See TS 38.213 [13].
totalNumberOfRA-Preambles
Total number of preambles used for contention based and contention free random access in the RACH resources defined in RACH-ConfigCommon, excluding preambles used for other purposes (e.g. for SI request). If the field is absent, all 64 preambles are available for RA. The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB, i.e. it should be a multiple of the number of SSBs per RACH occasion.

DRB-ToAddMod field descriptions
cnAssociation
Indicates if the bearer is associated with the eps-bearerIdentity (when connected to EPC) or sdap-Config (when connected to 5GC).
drb-Identity
In case of DC, the DRB identity is unique within the scope of the UE, i.e. an MCG DRB cannot use the same value as a split DRB. For a split DRB the same identity is used for the MCG and SCG parts of the configuration.
eps-BearerIdentity
The EPS bearer ID determines the EPS bearer.
reestablishPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to termination point change for the bearer, reconfiguration with sync, resuming an RRC connection, or the first reconfiguration after reestablishment. It is also applicable for LTE procedures when NR PDCP is configured.
recoverPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should perform recovery according to TS 38.323 [5].
sdap-Config
The SDAP configuration determines how to map QoS flows to DRBs when NR connects to the 5GC and presence/absence of UL/DL SDAP headers.

RadioBearerConfig field descriptions
securityConfig
Indicates the security algorithm and key to use for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this radioBearerConfig. When the field is not included after AS security has been activated, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse and security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this radioBearerConfig except for mobility from NR to E-UTRA/5GC. The field is not included when configuring SRB1 before AS security is activated.

Indicates if the bearers configured with the list in this radioBearerConfig is using the master key or the secondary key for deriving ciphering and/or integrity protection keys. For EN-DC, network should not configure SRB1 and SRB2 with secondary key and SRB3 with the master key. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this radioBearerConfig except for mobility from NR to E-UTRA/5GC.
securityAlgorithmConfig
Indicates the security algorithm for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this radioBearerConfig. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this radioBearerConfig except for mobility from NR to E-UTRA/5GC.

SRB-ToAddMod field descriptions
discardOnPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should discard stored SDU and PDU according to TS 38.323 [5].
reestablishPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to reconfiguration with sync, for SRB2 when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment in NR. For LTE SRBs using NR PDCP, it could be for handover, RRC connection reestablishment or resume.

RateMatchPattern field descriptions
bitmaps
Indicates rate matching pattern by a pair of bitmaps resourceBlocks and symbolsInResourceBlock to define the rate match pattern within one or two slots, and a third bitmap periodicityAndPattern to define the repetition pattern with which the pattern defined by the above bitmap pair occurs.
controlResourceSet
This ControlResourceSet is used as a PDSCH rate matching pattern, i.e., PDSCH reception rate matches around it. In frequency domain, the resource is determined by the frequency domain resource of the CORESET with the corresponding CORESET ID. Time domain resource is determined by the parameters of the associated search space of the CORESET.
periodicityAndPattern
A time domain repetition pattern at which the pattern defined by symbolsInResourceBlock and resourceBlocks recurs. This slot pattern repeats itself continuously. Absence of this field indicates the value n1, i.e., the symbolsInResourceBlock recurs every 14 symbols (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
resourceBlocks
A resource block level bitmap in the frequency domain. A bit in the bitmap set to 1 indicates that the UE shall apply rate matching in the corresponding resource block in accordance with the symbolsInResourceBlock bitmap. If used as cell-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "common resource blocks (CRB)". If used as BWP-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "physical resource blocks" inside the BWP. The first/ leftmost bit corresponds to resource block 0, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). 
subcarrierSpacing
The SubcarrierSpacing for this resource pattern. If the field is absent, the UE applies the SCS of the associated BWP. The value kHz15 corresponds to µ=0, the value kHz30 corresponds to µ=1, and so on. Only the values 15 kHz or 30 kHz (<6GHz), 60 kHz or 120 kHz (>6GHz) are applicable (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
symbolsInResourceBlock
A symbol level bitmap in time domain. It indicates with a bit set to true that the UE shall rate match around the corresponding symbol. The first/left-most bit in the bitmap corresponds to the first symbol in the slot, and so on. This pattern recurs (in time domain) with the configured periodicityAndPattern (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).

Conditional Presence
Explanation
CellLevel
The field is mandatory present if the RateMatchPattern is defined on cell level. The field is absent when the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level. If the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level, the UE applies the SCS of the BWP.

RLC-BearerConfig field descriptions
logicalChannelIdentity
ID used commonly for the MAC logical channel and for the RLC bearer.
reestablishRLC
Indicates that RLC should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for the radio bearer associated with this RLC entity changes. For SRB2 and DRBs, it is also set to true during the resumption of the RRC connection or the first reconfiguration after reestablishment.
rlc-Config
Determines the RLC mode (UM, AM) and provides corresponding parameters. RLC mode reconfiguration can only be performed by DRB release/addition or full configuration.
servedRadioBearer
Associates the RLC Bearer with an SRB or a DRB. The UE shall deliver DL RLC SDUs received via the RLC entity of this RLC bearer to the PDCP entity of the servedRadioBearer. Furthermore, the UE shall advertise and deliver uplink PDCP PDUs of the uplink PDCP entity of the servedRadioBearer to the uplink RLC entity of this RLC bearer unless the uplink scheduling restrictions ('moreThanOneRLC' in PDCP-Config and the restrictions in LogicalChannelConfig) forbid it to do so.

Conditional Presence
Explanation

SearchSpace field descriptions
common
Configures this search space as common search space (CSS) and DCI formats to monitor.
controlResourceSetId
The CORESET applicable for this SearchSpace. Value 0 identifies the common CORESET#0 configured in MIB and in ServingCellConfigCommon. Values 1..maxNrofControlResourceSets-1 identify CORESETs configured in System Information or by dedicated signalling. The CORESETs with non-zero controResourceSetId locate in the same BWP as this SearchSpace.
dummy1, dummy2
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
dci-Format0-0-AndFormat1-0
If configured, the UE monitors the DCI formats 0_0 and 1_0 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1.
dci-Format2-0
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_0 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.1.1.
dci-Format2-1
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_1 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.2.
dci-Format2-2
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_2 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.3.
dci-Format2-3
If configured, UE monitors the DCI format 2_3 according to TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1, 11.4
dci-Formats
Indicates whether the UE monitors in this USS for DCI formats 0-0 and 1-0 or for formats 0-1 and 1-1.
duration
Number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2_0. The UE ignores this field for DCI format 2_0. The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset).
monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset
Slots for PDCCH Monitoring configured as periodicity and offset. If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable.  If the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2_0, only the values ′sl1′, ′sl2′, ′sl4′, ′sl5′, ′sl8′, ′sl10′, ′sl16′, and ′sl20′ are applicable (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot
The first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE .
For DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 1 symbol.
See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.
nrofCandidates-SFI
The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-0 for the configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1.1).
nrofCandidates
Number of PDCCH candidates per aggregation level. The number of candidates and aggregation levels configured here applies to all formats unless a particular value is specified or a format-specific value is provided (see inside searchSpaceType). If configured in the SearchSpace of a cross carrier scheduled cell, this field determines the number of candidates and aggregation levels to be used on the linked scheduling cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
searchSpaceId
Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the searchSpaceZero configured via PBCH (MIB) or ServingCellConfigCommon and may hence not be used in the SearchSpace IE. The searchSpaceId is unique among the BWPs of a Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces with the same searchSpaceId in scheduled cell and scheduling cell are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both active.
searchSpaceType
Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for.
ue-Specific
Configures this search space as UE specific search space (USS). The UE monitors the DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI (if configured), and SP-CSI-RNTI (if configured)

Explanation
Setup
This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new SearchSpace. It is optionally present, Need M, otherwise.
SetupOnly
This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new SearchSpace. It is absent otherwise.

–	SearchSpaceId
The IE SearchSpaceId is used to identify Search Spaces. The ID space is used across the BWPs of a Serving Cell. The search space with the SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the search space configured via PBCH (MIB) and in ServingCellConfigCommon (searchSpaceZero). The number of Search Spaces per BWP is limited to 10 including the common and UE specific Search Spaces.

ServingCellConfig field descriptions
bwp-InactivityTimer
The duration in ms after which the UE falls back to the default Bandwidth Part. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15) The value 0.5 ms is only applicable for carriers >6 GHz. When the network releases the timer configuration, the UE stops the timer without switching to the default BWP.
crossCarrierSchedulingConfig
Indicates whether this serving cell is cross-carrier scheduled by another serving cell or whether it cross-carrier schedules another serving cell.
defaultDownlinkBWP-Id
The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BWP-Id = 0. ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be used upon expiry of the BWP inactivity timer. This field is UE specific. When the field is absent the UE uses the initial BWP as default BWP. (see  TS 38.213 [13], clause 12 and TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15).
downlinkBWP-ToAddModList
List of additional downlink bandwidth parts to be added or modified. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 12).
downlinkBWP-ToReleaseList
List of additional downlink bandwidth parts to be released. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 12).
downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List
A set of UE specific channel bandwidth and location configurations for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A. The UE uses the configuration provided in this field only for the purpose of channel bandwidth and location determination. If absent, UE uses the configuration indicated in scs-SpecificCarrierList in DownlinkConfigCommon / DownlinkConfigCommonSIB. Network only configures channel bandwidth that corresponds to the channel bandwidth values defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39].
firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id
If configured for an SpCell, this field contains the ID of the DL BWP to be activated upon performing the RRC (re-)configuration. If the field is absent, the RRC (re-)configuration does not impose a BWP switch.
If configured for an SCell, this field contains the ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be used upon MAC-activation of an SCell. The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BWP-Id = 0.
Upon reconfigurationWithSync (PCell handover, PSCelladdition/change), the network sets the firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id and firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id to the same value.
initialDownlinkBWP
The dedicated (UE-specific) configuration for the initial downlink bandwidth-part (i.e. DL BWP#0). If any of the optional IEs are configured within this IE, the UE considers the BWP#0 to be an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Otherwise, the UE does not consider the BWP#0 as an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Network always configures this field if no other BWPs are configured. NOTE1
lte-CRS-ToMatchAround
Parameters to determine an LTE CRS pattern that the UE shall rate match around.
pathlossReferenceLinking
Indicates whether UE shall apply as pathloss reference either the downlink of PCell or of SCell that corresponds with this uplink (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7).
pdsch-ServingCellConfig
PDSCH related parameters that are not BWP-specific.
rateMatchPatternToAddModList
Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around. The UE rate matches around the union of all resources indicated in the nested bitmaps. Rate match patterns defined here on cell level apply only to PDSCH of the same numerology. See TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.2.3.
sCellDeactivationTimer
SCell deactivation timer in TS 38.321 [3]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value infinity.
servingCellMO
measObjectId of the MeasObjectNR in MeasConfig which is associated to the serving cell. For this MeasObjectNR, the following relationship applies between this MeasObjectNR and frequencyInfoDL in ServingCellConfigCommon of the serving cell: if ssbFrequency is configured, its value is the same as the absoluteFrequencySSB and if csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility is configured, the value of its subcarrierSpacing is present in one entry of the scs-SpecificCarrierList, csi-RS-CellListMobility includes an entry corresponding to the serving cell (with cellId equal to physCellId in ServingCellConfigCommon) and the frequency range indicated by the csi-rs-MeasurementBW of the entry in csi-RS-CellListMobility is included in the frequency range indicated by in the entry of the scs-SpecificCarrierList.   
supplementaryUplink
Network may configure this field only when supplementaryUplinkConfig is configured in ServingCellConfigCommon or ServingCellConfigCommonSIB.
tag-Id
Timing Advance Group ID, as specified in TS 38.321 [3], which this cell belongs to.
uplinkConfig
Network may configure this field only when uplinkConfigCommon is configured in ServingCellConfigCommon or ServingCellConfigCommonSIB.

UplinkConfig field descriptions
carrierSwitching
Includes parameters for configuration of carrier based SRS switching (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1.3.
firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id
If configured for an SpCell, this field contains the ID of the UL BWP to be activated upon performing the RRC (re-)configuration. If the field is absent, the RRC (re-)configuration does not impose a BWP switch.
If configured for an SCell, this field contains the ID of the uplink bandwidth part to be used upon MAC-activation of an SCell. The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BandiwdthPartId = 0.
initialUplinkBWP
The dedicated (UE-specific) configuration for the initial uplink bandwidth-part (i.e. UL BWP#0). If any of the optional IEs are configured within this IE as part of the IE uplinkConfig, the UE considers the BWP#0 to be an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Otherwise, the UE does not consider the BWP#0 as an RRC configured BWP (from UE capability viewpoint). Network always configures this field if no other BWPs are configured. NOTE1
powerBoostPi2BPSK
If this field is set to true, the UE determines the maximum output power for PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions that use pi/2 BPSK modulation according to TS 38.101-1 [15], clause 6.2.4.
pusch-ServingCellConfig
PUSCH related parameters that are not BWP-specific.
uplinkBWP-ToReleaseList
The additional bandwidth parts for uplink. In case of TDD uplink- and downlink BWP with the same bandwidthPartId are considered as a BWP pair and must have the same center frequency.
uplinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List
A set of UE specific channel bandwidth and location configurations for different subcarrier spacings (numerologies). Defined in relation to Point A. The UE uses the configuration provided in this field only for the purpose of channel bandwidth and location determination. If absent, UE uses the configuration indicated in scs-SpecificCarrierList in UplinkConfigCommon / UplinkConfigCommonSIB. Network only configures channel bandwidth that corresponds to the channel bandwidth values defined in TS 38.101-1 [15] and TS 38.101-2 [39].

NOTE 1:	If the dedicated part of initial UL/DL BWP configuration is not present, the initial BWP can be used but with some limitations. For example, changing to another BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn't support DCI-based switching.

BandCombination field descriptions
BandCombinationList-v1540
The UE shall include the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in BandCombinationList (without suffix).
powerClass
Power class that the UE supports when operating according to this band combination. If the field is absent, the UE supports the default power class. If this power class is higher than the power class that the UE supports on the individual bands of this band combination (ue-PowerClass in BandNR), the latter determines maximum TX power available in each band. The UE sets the new power class parameter only in band combinations with two FR1 uplink serving cells. 
supportedBandwidthCombinationSet
For NR SA and for inter-band EN-DC, the field defines the bandwidth combinations for the NR part of the band combination. For intra-band EN-DC, the field indicates the supported bandwidth combination set applicable to the NR and LTE band combinations. The first (left-most) bit in the bitmap corresponds to the BWCS#0 and so on. If the bit is set to 1, the UE supports the corresponding BWCS.
srs-SwitchingTimesListNR
Indicates, for a particular pair of NR bands, the RF retuning time when switching between a NR carrier corresponding to this band entry and another (PUSCH-less) NR carrier corresponding to the band entry in the order indicated below:
-	For the first NR band, the UE shall include the same number of entries for NR bands as in bandList, i.e. first entry corresponds to first NR band in bandList and so on,
-	For the second NR band, the UE shall include one entry less, i.e. first entry corresponds to the second NR band in bandList and so on
-	And so on

–	FeatureSetCombination
The IE FeatureSetCombination is a two-dimensional matrix of FeatureSet entries.
Each FeatureSetsPerBand contains a list of feature sets applicable to the carrier(s) of one band entry of the associated band combination. Across the associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand. All FeatureSetsPerBand in one FeatureSetCombination must have the same number of entries.
The number of FeatureSetsPerBand in the FeatureSetCombination must be equal to the number of band entries in an associated band combination. The first FeatureSetPerBand applies to the first band entry of the band combination, and so on.
Each FeatureSet contains either a pair of NR or E-UTRA feature set IDs for UL and DL.
In case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the FeatureSets IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their position in the featureSetsUplink / featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSet IE.
In case of E-UTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are defined in TS 36.331 [10] and conveyed as part of the UE-EUTRA-Capability container.
The FeatureSetUplink and FeatureSetDownlink referred to from the FeatureSet comprise, among other information, a set of FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id:s and FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id:s. The number of these per-CC IDs determines the number of carriers that the UE is able to aggregate contiguously in frequency domain in the corresponding band. The number of carriers supported by the UE is also restricted by the supportedBandwidthCombinationSet indicated in the associated BandCombination, if present.
In feature set combinations the UE shall exclude entries for fallback combinations with same capabilities, since the network may anyway assume that the UE supports those.
NOTE 1:	The UE may advertise fallback band-combinations in which it supports additional functionality explicitly in two ways: Either by setting FeatureSet IDs to zero (inter-band and intra-band non-contiguous fallback) and by reducing the number of FeatureSet-PerCC Ids in a Feature Set (intra-band contiguous fallback). Or by separate BandCombination entries with associated FeatureSetCombinations.
NOTE 2:	The UE may advertise a FeatureSetCombination containing only fallback band combinations. That means, in a FeatureSetCombination, each group of FeatureSets across the bands may contain at least one pair of FeatureSetUplinkId and FeatureSetDownlinkId which is set to 0/0.
NOTE 3:	The UE expects the serving cell(s) and BWP(s) configuration from the network to comply with capabilities derived from the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand, regardless of activated/deactivated serving cell(s) and BWP(s).

FeatureSetDownlink field descriptions
crossCarrierScheduling-OtherSCS
The UE shall set this field to the same value as crossCarrierScheduling-OtherSCS in the associated FeatureSetUplink (if present).
featureSetListPerDownlinkCC
Indicates which features the UE supports on the individual carriers of the feature set (and hence of a band entry that refer to the feature set). The UE shall hence include at least as many FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in this list as the number of carriers it supports according to the ca-BandwidthClassDL. The order of the elements in this list is not relevant, i.e., the network may configure any of the carriers in accordance with any of the FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in this list.

–	FeatureSetDownlinkId
The IE FeatureSetDownlinkId identifies a downlink feature set. The FeatureSetDownlinkId of a FeatureSetDownlink is the index position of the FeatureSetDownlink in the featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSets IE. The first element in that list is referred to by FeatureSetDownlinkId = 1. The FeatureSetDownlinkId=0 is not used by an actual FeatureSetDownlink but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band combination.

–	FeatureSets
The IE FeatureSets is used to provide pools of downlink and uplink features sets. A FeatureSetCombination refers to the IDs of the feature set(s) that the UE supports in that FeatureSetCombination. The BandCombination entries in the BandCombinationList then indicate the ID of the FeatureSetCombination that the UE supports for that band combination.
The entries in the lists in this IE are identified by their index position. For example, the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id = 4 identifies the 4th element in the featureSetsUplinkPerCC list.
NOTE:	When feature sets (per CC) IEs require extension in future versions of the specification, new versions of the FeatureSetDownlink, FeatureSetUplink, FeatureSets, FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC and/or FeatureSetUplinkPerCC will be created and instantiated in corresponding new lists in the FeatureSets IE. For example, if new capability bits are to be added to the FeatureSetDownlink, they will instead be defined in a new FeatureSetDownlink-rxy which will be instantiated in a new featureSetDownlinkList-rxy list. If a UE indicates in a FeatureSetCombination that it supports the FeatureSetDownlink with ID #5, it implies that it supports both the features in FeatureSetDownlink #5 and FeatureSetDownlink-rxy #5 (if present). The number of entries in the new list(s) shall be the same as in the original list(s).

FeatureSetUplink field descriptions
crossCarrierScheduling-OtherSCS
The UE shall set this field to the same value as crossCarrierScheduling-OtherSCS in the associated FeatureSetDownlink (if present).
featureSetsPerUplinkCC
Indicates which features the UE supports on the individual carriers of the feature set (and hence of a band entry that refers to the feature set). The UE shall hence include at least as many FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in this list as the number of carriers it supports according to the ca-BandwidthClassUL. The order of the elements in this list is not relevant, i.e., the network may configure any of the carriers in accordance with any of the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in this list.

–	FeatureSetUplinkId
The IE FeatureSetUplinkId identifies an uplink feature set. The FeatureSetUplinkId of a FeatureSetUplink is the index position of the FeatureSetUplink in the featureSetsUplink list in the FeatureSets IE. The first element in the list is referred to by FeatureSetUplinkId = 1, and so on. The FeatureSetUplinkId =0 is not used by an actual FeatureSetUplink but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band combination.

8	Protocol data unit abstract syntax
8.1	General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6] and X.681 [7]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [8].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691:
-	When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;
NOTE:	The terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680. When using the 'bstring' notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.
-	When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint ("CONTAINING"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a separate step;
-	When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU, BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
8.2	Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs (in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
8.3	Basic production
The 'basic production' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains a multiple of 8 bits.
8.4	Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall, unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty extensions;
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set spare bits to zero.
8.5	Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of 8.

Figure 8.5-1: RRC level padding
9	Specified and default radio configurations
Specified and default configurations are configurations of which the details are specified in the standard. Specified configurations are fixed while default configurations can be modified using dedicated signalling. The default value for the parameters not listed in following subclauses shall be set such as the corresponding features are not configured, i.e. release or false unless explicitly stated otherwise.
NOTE:	The UE applies the default values specified in the field description of ASN.1 parameters only when the parent IE is present. Hence, the UE does not apply all default values in field descriptions when it applies the "default radio configuration" in accordance with this clause.

If the UE is to apply default configuration while it is configured with some critically extended fields, the UE shall apply the original version of those fields with only default values.
NOTE 1:	In general, the signalling should preferably support a "release" option for fields introduced after v15.3.0. The "value not applicable" should be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields which value is relevant only if another field is set to a value other than its default.
NOTE 2:	For parameters in ServingCellConfig, the default values are specified in the corresponding specification.

10	Generic error handling
10.1	General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent sub-clauses applies unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
-	to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer syntax supported by the UE;
-	to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
-	as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved field.
10.2	ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1>	when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, CCCH or PCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid [6]:
2>	ignore the message.
NOTE:	This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message level.
10.3	Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	if a default value is defined for this field:
3>	treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2>	else if the concerned field is optional:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the need code for absence of the concerned field;
2>	else:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with sub-clause 10.4.
10.4	Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1>	if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field is absent or treated as absent:
2>	if the RRC message was received on DCCH or CCCH:
3>	ignore the message;
2>	else:
3>	if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE OF):
4>	treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended field was not present;
3>	else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the 'parent' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the erroneous field:
4>	consider the 'parent' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4>	apply the generic error handling to the subsequent 'parent' field(s), until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3>	else (field at message level):
4>	ignore the message.
NOTE 1:	The error handling defined in these sub-clauses implies that the UE ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended value.
NOTE 2:	The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels other than DCCH and CCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for errors that can be regarded as invalid network operation e.g. the network not observing conditional presence.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested error handling for errors in extension fields.
-- /example/ ASN1START

-- Example with extension addition group

ItemInfoList ::=                    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OFItemInfo

ItemInfo ::=                        SEQUENCE {
    itemIdentity                        INTEGER (1..max),
    field1                              Field1,

    nonCriticalExtension                BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs    OPTIONAL
}

BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs::=	SEQUENCE {
    field3-r9                           Field3-r9               OPTIONAL,           -- Cond Cond1
    field4-r9                           Field4-r9               OPTIONAL,           -- Need N
    nonCriticalExtension                SEQUENCE {}             OPTIONAL            -- Need S
}

-- ASN1STOP

The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable in case of nested error handling:
-	an extension additon group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than just the extension addition group containing field3 and field4);
-	a traditional nonCriticalExtension is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, an error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire BroadcastInfoBlock1 to be ignored (rather than just the non-critical extension containing field3 and field4).
10.5	Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.
NOTE:	This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in clause 10.3.
11	Radio information related interactions between network nodes
11.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the NR radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
11.2	Inter-node RRC messages
11.2.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-, Xn- or the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single 'logical channel' is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

CG-Config field descriptions
candidateCellInfoListSN
Contains information regarding cells that the source secondary node suggests the target secondary gNB to consider configuring.
candidateServingFreqListNR
Indicates frequencies of candidate serving cells for In-Device Co-existence Indication (see TS 36.331 [10]).
configRestrictModReq
Used by SN to request changes to SCG configuration restrictions previously set by MN to ensure UE capabilities are respected. E.g. can used to request configuring an NR band combination whose use MN has previously forbidden.
fr-InfoListSCG
Contains information of FR information of serving cells that include PScell and Scells configured in SCG.
measuredFrequenciesSN
Used by SN to indicate a list of frequencies measured by the UE.
ph-InfoSCG
Power headroom information in SCG that is needed in the reception of PHR MAC CE of MCG
ph-SupplementaryUplink
Power headroom information for supplementary uplink. In the case of EN-DC, this field is only present when two UL carriers are configued for a serving cell and one UL carrier reports type1 PH while the other reports type 3 PH. 
ph-Type1or3
Type of power headroom for a certain serving cell in SCG (PSCell and activated SCells). Value type1 refers to type 1 power headroom, value type3 refers to type 3 power headroom. (See TS 38.321 [3]).
ph-Uplink
Power headroom information for uplink.
pSCellFrequency
Indicates the frequency of PSCell.
reportCGI-Request
Used by SN to indicate to MN about configuring reportCGI procedure. The request may optionally contain information about the cell for which SN intends to configure reportCGI procedure.
requestedP-MaxFR1
Requested value for the maximum power for the serving cells on frequency range 1 (FR1) in this secondary cell group (see TS 38.104 [12]) the UE can use in NR SCG.
requestedBC-MRDC
Used to request configuring an NR band combination and corresponding feature sets which are forbidden to use by MN. 
scg-CellGroupConfig
Contains the RRCReconfiguration message:
-	to be sent to the UE, used upon SCG establishment or modification, as generated (entirely) by the (target) SgNB, or
-	including the current SCG configuration of the UE, when provided in response to a query from MN.
The SN sets the RRCReconfiguration message in accordance with section 6 e.g.regarding the "Need" or "Cond" statements. The field is absent if neither SCG (re)configuration nor SCG configuration query is performed, e.g. at inter-node capability/configuration coordination which does not result in SCG (re)configuration towards the UE.
scg-RB-Config
Contains the IE RadioBearerConfig:
-	to be sent to the UE, used to (re-)configure the SCG RB configuration upon SCG establishment or modification, as generated (entirely) by the (target) SgNB, or
-	including the current SCG RB configuration of the UE, when provided in response to a query from MN.
The SN sets the RadioBearerConfig message in accordance with section 6, e.g. regarding the "Need" or "Cond" statements. The field is absent if neither SCG (re)configuration nor SCG configuration query is performed, e.g. at inter-node capability/configuration coordination which does not result in SCG RB (re)configuration.
selectedBandCombinationNR
Indicates the band combination selected by SN for the EN-DC.


BandCombinationInfoSN field descriptions
bandCombinationIndex
The position of a band combination in the supportedBandCombinationList
requestedFeatureSets
The position in the FeatureSetCombination which identifies one FeatureSetUplink/Downlink for each band entry in the associated band combination

12	Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time in [ms] from the end of reception of the network -> UE message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the UE -> network response message with no access delay other than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access procedure or physical layer synchronisation). In case the RRC procedure triggers BWP switching, the RRC procedure delay is the value defined in the following table plus the BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133 [14], clause 8.6.3.

Annex A (informative):	Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
A.1	Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
A.2	Procedural specification
A.2.1	General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU section e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are sent to the network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
A.2.2	More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
-	Bullets:
-	Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'
-	All bullets, including the last one in a sub-clause, should end with a semi-colon i.e. an ';.
-	Conditions:
-	Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if cond1, or cond2.
A.3	PDU specification
A.3.1	General principles
A.3.1.1	ASN.1 sections
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [13], X.681 (02/2002) [14].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in the specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins with the following:
-	a first text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "ASN1START" (in all upper case letters);
-	a second text paragraph consisting entirely of a block start tag is included, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "TAG-NAME-START" (in all upper case letters), where the "NAME" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters).
Similarly, each ASN.1 section ends with the following:
-	a first text paragraph consisting entirely of a blockstop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "TAG-NAME-STOP" (in all upper-case letters), where the "NAME" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters);
-	a second text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a singlespace and the text "ASN1STOP" (in all upper case letters).
This results in the following tags:
-- ASN1START
-- TAG-NAME-START

-- TAG-NAME-STOP
-- ASN1STOP

The text paragraphs containing either of the start and stop tags should not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE:	A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
A.3.1.2	ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:
-	Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviations should be avoided in these identifiers and abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
-	Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the "d" in "Selected" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.
-	Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.
-	Identifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should avoid adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like 'Info') for the name.
-	Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.
-	Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
-	For future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A suffix of the form "‑rX" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. A suffix of the form "‑rXb" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, "‑rXc" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form "‑vXYZ" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or type (see sub-clause A.4), e.g., AnElement-v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.
-	More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.
-	It should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name within the elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a SEQUENCE (to avoid certain compiler errors).

NOTE:	The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
A.3.1.3	Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the specification is made using the ASN.1 field identifier of the referenced type. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the italic font style. The "do not check spelling and grammar" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., "") should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "message", e.g., a reference to the RRCRelease message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "field", e.g., a reference to the prioritisedBitRate field in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=            SEQUENCE {
    ul-SpecificParameters               SEQUENCE {
        priority                            Priority,
        prioritisedBitRate                  PrioritisedBitRate,
        bucketSizeDuration                  BucketSizeDuration,
        logicalChannelGroup                 INTEGER (0..3)
    }       OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

NOTE:	All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples in this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym "IE", e.g., a reference to the IE LogicalChannelConfig in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1 value, e.g., 'if the status field is set to value true'.
A.3.2	High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
    message                 DL-DCCH-MessageType
}

DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
    c1                      CHOICE {
        dlInformationTransfer                   DLInformationTransfer,
        handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest     HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
        mobilityFromEUTRACommand                MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
        rrcConnectionReconfiguration            RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
        rrcConnectionRelease                    RRCConnectionRelease,
        securityModeCommand                     SecurityModeCommand,
        ueCapabilityEnquiry                     UECapabilityEnquiry,
        spare1 NULL
    },
    messageClassExtension   SEQUENCE {}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using the messageClassExtension alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
A.3.3	Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::=    SEQUENCE {
    rrc-TransactionIdentifier           RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
    criticalExtensions                  CHOICE {
        c1                                  CHOICE{
            rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8     RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
            spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
        },
        criticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}
    }
}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    -- Enter the IEs here.
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Hooks for critical and non-critical extension should normally be included in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described in sub-clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
    rrc-TransactionIdentifier           RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
    criticalExtensions                  CHOICE {
        rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
                                            RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
        criticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}
    }
}

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    -- Enter the fields here.
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker "...". The original specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by use of an empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=                   SEQUENCE {
    field1                                  InformationElement1,
    field2                                  InformationElement2,

    nonCriticalExtension                    SEQUENCE {}                     OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.
%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions
%field identifier%
Field description.
%field identifier%
Field description.

The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/or specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be omitted from the field description table.
A.3.4	Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-ConfigSIB ::=                 SEQUENCE {
    rootSequenceIndex                   INTEGER (0..1023),
    prach-ConfigInfo                    PRACH-ConfigInfo
}

PRACH-Config ::=                    SEQUENCE {
    rootSequenceIndex                   INTEGER (0..1023),
    prach-ConfigInfo                    PRACH-ConfigInfo                    OPTIONAL    -- Need N
}

PRACH-ConfigInfo ::=                SEQUENCE {
    prach-ConfigIndex                   ENUMERATED {ffs},
    highSpeedFlag                       ENUMERATED {ffs},
    zeroCorrelationZoneConfig           ENUMERATED {ffs}
}

-- ASN1STOP

IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together in a common ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The "PRACH-Config" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the "SIB" suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The sub-clause heading and generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the protocol (see sub-clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in sub-clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 section should be defined in a separate sub-clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 section (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.
NOTE:	Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the field description table is the same as shown in sub-clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.
A.3.5	Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a value for that field in the encoding:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PreambleInfo ::=                    SEQUENCE {
    numberOfRA-Preambles                INTEGER (1..64)                     DEFAULT 1,
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-Config ::=                SEQUENCE {
    rootSequenceIndex                   INTEGER (0..1023),
    prach-ConfigInfo                    PRACH-ConfigInfo                    OPTIONAL    -- Need N
}

-- ASN1STOP

The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted, should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need code. The need code includes the keyword "Need", followed by one of the predefined semantics tags (S, M, N or R) defined in sub-clause 6.1. If the semantics tag S is used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in procedure text.
The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE, then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one field in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group level.
A.3.6	Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword "Cond", followed by a condition tag associated with the field ("UL" in this example):
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=            SEQUENCE {
    ul-SpecificParameters               SEQUENCE {
        priority                            INTEGER (0),
        ...
    }       OPTIONAL                                                                    -- Cond UL
}

-- ASN1STOP

When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the field description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a conditional presence table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1 section.
Conditional presence
Explanation
UL
Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the condition tag = "UL". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.

The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading: "Conditional presence") contains the condition tag (in italic font style), which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 section to an entry in the table. The second column (heading: "Explanation") contains a text specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field depends on the presence and/or value of other fields within the same message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another feature/function has been configured, while this function can be configured independently e.g. by another message and/or at another point in time, the relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the field description table.
If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional presence, the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of conditional presence should be considered.
A.3.7	Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::=               SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo

PLMN-IdentityInfo ::=               SEQUENCE {
    plmn-Identity                       PLMN-Identity,
    cellReservedForOperatorUse          ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP

rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code to contain types with unpredictable names:
-- /bad example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::=                   SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OFSEQUENCE {
    plmn-Identity                           PLMN-Identity,
    cellReservedForOperatorUse              ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A.3.8	Guidelines on use of parameterised SetupRelease type
The usage of the parameterised SetupRelease type is like a function call in programming languages where the element type parameter is passed as a parameter. The parameterised type only implies a textual change in abstract syntax where all references to the parameterised type are replaced by the compiler with the release/setup choice. Two examples of the usage are shown below:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r15-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-r15               SetupRelease { IE-r15 }                 OPTIONAL,   --  Need M
    ...
}


RRCMessage-r15-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-r15       SetupRelease { Element-r15 }
}                                                                   OPTIONAL,   -- Need M

Element-r15 ::= SEQUENCE {
    field1-r15                  IE1-r15,
    field2-r15                  IE2-r15                             OPTIONAL    -- Need N
}                                                                   OPTIONAL,   -- Need M

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

The SetupRelease is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the example below is not allowed:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r15-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-r15       SetupRelease { SEQUENCE {   -- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not allowed!
            field1-r15                  IE1-r15,
            field2-r15                  IE2-r15                         OPTIONAL    -- Need N
        }
    }                                                                   OPTIONAL,   -- Need M
}

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for the type itself, namely, "setup" and "release". For example, procedural text for field-r15 above could be as follows:
1> if field-r15 is set to "setup":
2> do something;
1> else (field-r15 is set to "release"):
2> release field-r15 (if appropriate).
A.3.9	Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList
In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be used. Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the ASN.1 provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements that are to be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list conveys only the identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be released from the list. In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means to signal modifications to a list maintained in the receiver (typically the UE). An example is provided below:
-- /example/ ASN1START

AnExampleIE ::=         SEQUENCE {
    elementsToAddModList    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element                                     OPTIONAL,   --  Need N
    elementsToReleaseList   SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId                                   OPTIONAL,   --  Need N
    ...
}

Element ::=         SEQUENCE {
    elementId               ElementId,
    aField                  INTEG ER (0..16777215),
    anotherField            OCTET STRING,
    ...
}

ElementId ::=           INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)

maxNrofElements         INTEGER ::= 50
maxNrofElements-1       INTEGER ::= 49

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

As can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity (INTEGER) that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition, modification and removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that identifier (here ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field inside the element as well as in the elementsToReleaseList.
Both lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as "Need N". The need code reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such but rather updates its configuration using the information therein. In other words, it is not possible to provide via delta signalling an update to a previously signalled elementsToAddModList or elementsToReleaseList (which Need M would imply). The update is always in relation to the UE's internal configuration.
If no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList, the following generic procedure applies:
The UE shall:
1>	for each ElementId in the elementsToReleaseList,:
2>	if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:
3>	release the Element from the current UE configuration;
1>	for each Element in the elementsToAddModList:
2>	if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:
3>	modify the configured Element in accordance with the received Element;
2>	else:
3>	add received Element to the UE configuration.
A.4	Extension of the PDU specifications
A.4.1	General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
-	Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected behaviour or damage).
-	Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of the other parts of the message).
-	Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when there is a need to introduce a 'clean' message version. Such a need appears when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical extension mechanisms.
A.4.2	Critical extension of messages and fields
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are both "outer branch" and "inner branch" mechanisms available. The "outer branch" consists of a CHOICE having the name criticalExtensions, with two values, c1 and criticalExtensionsFuture. The criticalExtensionsFuture branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the "inner branch" mechanism.
The "inner branch" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form "MessageName-rX-IEs" (e.g., "RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs") or "spareX", with the spare values having type NULL. The "-rX-IEs" structures contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an 'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain number of spares:
-	For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
-	An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
-	The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values). The estimation of the critical extension likelihood may be based on the number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
-	In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release

It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be included (e.g. original field is mandatory, E-UTRAN is unaware if UE supports the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release.

Explanation
NoField2rN
The field is optionally present, need N, if field2-rN is absent. Otherwise the field is not present

Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to assist the network in deciding whether or not to use the critically extension.
A.4.3	Non-critical extension of messages
A.4.3.1	General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional guidelines apply:
-	When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
-	The extension marker ("...") is the primary non-critical extension mechanism that is used but empty sequences may be used if length determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:
-	at the end of a message;
-	at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
-	When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the 'default extension location').
-	It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible level.
-	In specific cases it may be preferable to place extensions elsewhere (referred to as the 'actual extension location') e.g. when it is possible to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message. <TBD: ref to separate example>
-	In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher level in the message should be considered.
-	In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE should be defined. The IE's ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there are intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location, an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not always be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 section. <TBD: ref to separate example>
A.4.3.2	Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous section, the following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
-	Extension markers within SEQUENCE:
-	Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the higher nesting levels.
-	Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list).
-	Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT.
-	Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully.
-	The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the specification are grouped together using double brackets.
-	Extension markers within ENUMERATED:
-	Spare values may be used until the number of values reaches the next power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit, given that the use of spare values in a later Release is possible without any error cases.
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new value, e.g. "value-vXYZ".
-	Extension markers within CHOICE:
-	Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g. ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the extended value.
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new choice value, e.g. "choice-vXYZ".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an OCTET or BIT STRING:
-	When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a "Need" code should not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a "Need" code when the field is not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
-	In case a need code is not provided for a group, a "Need" code is provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e. including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.
A.4.3.3	Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism is used.
NOTE	In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.

    ]]
}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions of InformationElement1 as shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement1 is initially extended with a number of non-critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE InformationElement1 (i.e. InformationElement1-r10) is defined in which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the original field.
–	The value4-v880 is replacing a spare value defined in the original protocol version for field1. Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare3 that was originally defined in the r10 version of field1.
–	Within the critically extended release 10 version of InformationElement1, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g. the field1 and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the field3-r9 is introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged; although, the InformationElement3 is also critically extended and therefore tagged InformationElement3-r10 in the release 10 version of InformationElement1.
A.4.3.4	Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.

    field5-v860                     BOOLEAN                             OPTIONAL,   -- Cond C54

    nonCriticalExtensions           SEQUENCE {}                         OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement4 is introduced in the original version of the protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
A.4.3.5	Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
–	ParentIE-WithEM
The IE ParentIE-WithEMis an example of a high level IE including the extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.

    ]]
}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The fields childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0 may not really need to be optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
–	In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.
–	ChildIE1-WithoutEM
The IE ChildIE1-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, used to control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be setup or released using the local IE ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature. The example illustrates how the new field chIE1-NewField is added in release N to the configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the following assumptions:
–	When initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
–	When the configurable feature is released, the new field should be released also.
–	When omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
–	When omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.

A.5	Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a Transaction identifier
1:	DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC transaction identifier.
2:	All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC transaction identifier.
3:	All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4:	All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an RRC transaction identifier.
5:	All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction identifier.
A.6	Guidelines regarding use of need codes
The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for optional downlink fields:
- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when absent:
- use Need M (=Maintain);
- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:
- use Need R (=Release);
- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE does not even need to maintain any existing value of the field):
- use Need N (=None);
- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above conditions):
- use Need S (=Specified);
- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural text or in the field description table.
A.7	Guidelines regarding use of conditions
Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which the following types can be distinguished:
-	Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field B is mandatory present if the same message includes field A and when it is set value X.
-	Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field D can only be signalled if field C is configured and set to value Y. (i.e. regardless of whether field C is present in the same message or previously configured).
The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.

B.2	Description of BWP configuration options
There are two possible ways to configure BWP#0 (i.e. the initial BWP) for a UE:
1)	Configure BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon, but do not configure BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.
2)	Configure both BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon and configure at least one of BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.
With the first option (illustrated by figure B2-1 below), the BWP#0 is not considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP can still be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. The BWP#0 can still be used even if it does not have the dedicated configuration, albeit in a more limited manner since only the SIB1-defined configurations are available. For example, only DCI format 1_0 can be used with BWP#0 without dedicated configuration, so changing to another BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn't support DCI-based switching.

Figure B2-1: BWP#0 configuration without dedicated configuration
With the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP#0 is considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP cannot be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch to and from BWP#0 e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit limitations to using the BWP#0 (compared to the first option).

Figure B2-2: BWP#0 configuration with dedicated configuration
For BWP#0, the BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.
