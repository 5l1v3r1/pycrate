4	General
4.1	Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating eNB exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating eNB shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the initiating message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including Criticality Diagnostics IE, see section 10. 
4.2	Forwards and backwards compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded regardless of the standard version.
4.3	Specification notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure	When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g. Handover Preparation procedure.
Message	When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word "message", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.
IE	When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the Information Element Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the abbreviation "IE", e.g. E-RAB ID IE.
Value of an IE	When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in sub clause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. "Value".
5	X2AP services
The present clause describes the services an eNB offers to its neighbours.
5.1	X2AP procedure modules
The X2 interface X2AP procedures are divided into two modules as follows:
1.	X2AP Basic Mobility Procedures;
2.	X2AP Global Procedures;
The X2AP Basic Mobility Procedures module contains procedures used to handle the UE mobility within E-UTRAN.
The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to a specific UE. The procedures in this module are in contrast to the above module involving two peer eNBs.
5.2	Parallel transactions
Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any instance in time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing X2AP procedure related to a certain UE.
6	Services expected from signalling transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of X2AP messages. X2AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
X2 signalling transport is described in TS 36.422 [21].
7	Functions of X2AP
The X2AP protocol provides the following functions:
-	Mobility Management. This function allows the eNB to move the responsibility of a certain UE to another eNB. Forwarding of user plane data, Status Transfer and UE Context Release function are parts of the mobility management.
-	Dual Connectivity. This function allows the eNB to request another eNB to provide radio resources for a certain UE while keeping responsibility for that UE.
-	Load Management. This function is used by eNBs to indicate resource status, overload and traffic load to each other.
-	Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting of general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not been defined.
-	Resetting the X2. This function is used to reset the X2 interface. 
-	Setting up the X2. This function is used to exchange necessary data for the eNB for setup the X2 interface and implicitly perform an X2 Reset.
-	eNB Configuration Update. This function allows updating of application level data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over the X2 interface. 
-	Mobility Parameters Management. This function allows the eNB to coordinate adaptation of mobility parameter settings with a peer eNB. 
-	Mobility Robustness Optimisation. This function allows reporting of information related to mobility failure events. 
-	Energy Saving. This function allows decreasing energy consumption by enabling indication of cell activation/deactivation over the X2 interface.
-	X2 Release. This function allows an eNB to be aware that the signalling connection to a peer eNB is unavailable.
-	Message Transfer. This function allows indirect transport of X2AP messages to a peer eNB.
-	Registration. This function allows registration of eNB in case indirect transport of X2AP messages is supported.
-	Removing the X2. This function allows removing the signaling connection between two eNBs in a controlled manner.
-	Inter-eNB UE Context Resume. This function allows retrieval of a suspended UE context.
The mapping between the above functions and X2 EPs is shown in the table below.

8.2	Basic mobility procedures
8.2.1	Handover Preparation
8.2.1.1	General
This procedure is used to establish necessary resources in an eNB for an incoming handover.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: Handover Preparation, successful operation
The source eNB initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target eNB. When the source eNB sends the HANDOVER REQUEST message, it shall start the timer TRELOCprep. 
The allocation of resources according to the values of the Allocation and Retention Priority IE included in the E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE shall follow the principles described for the E-RAB Setup procedure in TS 36.413 [4].
The source eNB may include in the GUMMEI IE any GUMMEI corresponding to the source MME node.
If at least one of the requested non-GBR E-RABs is admitted to the cell indicated by the Target Cell ID IE, the target eNB shall reserve necessary resources, and send the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message back to the source eNB. The target eNB shall include the E-RABs for which resources have been prepared at the target cell in the E-RABs Admitted List IE. The target eNB shall include the E-RABs that have not been admitted in the E-RABs Not Admitted List IE with an appropriate cause value.
At reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target eNB shall:
-	prepare the configuration of the AS security relation between the UE and the target eNB by using the information in the UE Security Capabilities IE and the AS Security Information IE in the UE Context Information IE.
For each E-RAB for which the source eNB proposes to do forwarding of downlink data, the source eNB shall include the DL Forwarding IE within the E-RABs To be Setup Item IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST message. For each E-RAB that it has decided to admit, the target eNB may include the DL GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE within the E-RABs Admitted Item IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to indicate that it accepts the proposed forwarding of downlink data for this bearer. This GTP tunnel endpoint may be different from the corresponding GTP TEID IE in the E-RAB To Be Switched in Downlink List IE of the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message (see TS 36.413 [4]) depending on implementation choice.
For each bearer in the E-RABs Admitted List IE, the target eNB may include the UL GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE to indicate that it requests data forwarding of uplink packets to be performed for that bearer.
Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the source eNB shall stop the timer TRELOCprep, start the timer TX2RELOCoverall and terminate the Handover Preparation procedure. The source eNB is then defined to have a Prepared Handover for that X2 UE-associated signalling.
If the Trace Activation IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message then the target eNB shall, if supported, initiate the requested trace function as described in TS 32.422 [6]. In particular, the target eNB shall, if supported:
-	if the Trace Activation IE does not include the MDT Configuration IE, initiate the requested trace session as described in TS 32.422 [6];
-	if the Trace Activation IE includes the MDT Activation IE, within the MDT Configuration IE, set to “Immediate MDT and Trace” initiate the requested trace session and MDT session as described in TS 32.422 [6];
-	if the Trace Activation IE includes the MDT Activation IE, within the MDT Configuration IE, set to “Immediate MDT Only” initiate the requested MDT session as described in TS 32.422 [6] and the target eNB shall ignore Interfaces To Trace IE, and Trace Depth IE;
-	if the Trace Activation IE includes the MDT Location Information IE, within the MDT Configuration IE, store this information and take it into account in the requested MDT session;
-	if the Trace Activation IE includes the Signalling based MDT PLMN List IE, within the MDT Configuration IE, the eNB may use it to propagate the MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 [31].
If the Management Based MDT Allowed IE only or the Management Based MDT Allowed IE and the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store the received information in the UE context, and use this information to allow subsequent selection of the UE for management based MDT defined in TS 32.422 [6].
If the Masked IMEISV IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target eNB shall, if supported, use it to determine the characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.
The source eNB shall, if supported and available in the UE context, include the Management Based MDT Allowed IE and the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, except if the source eNB selects a serving PLMN in the target eNB which is not included in the Management Based MDT PLMN List. If the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE is not present, the source eNB shall, if supported, include the Management Based MDT Allowed IE, if this information is available in the UE context, in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, except if the source eNB selects a serving PLMN in the target eNB different from the serving PLMN in the source eNB.
If the Handover Restriction List IE is
-	contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall
-	store the information received in the Handover Restriction List IE in the UE context;
-	use this information to determine a target for the UE during subsequent mobility action for which the eNB provides information about the target of the mobility action towards the UE, except when one of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value (TS 23.401 [12]) in which case the information shall not apply;
-	use this information to select a proper SCG during dual connectivity operation.
-	not contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall consider that no roaming and no access restriction apply to the UE.
If the Location Reporting Information IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message then the target eNB should initiate the requested location reporting functionality as defined in TS 36.413 [4].
If the SRVCC Operation Possible IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall store the content of such IE in the UE context and use it as defined in TS 23.216 [20].
●	If the UE Security Capabilities IE included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message only contains the EIA0 algorithm as defined in TS 33.401 [18] and if this EIA0 algorithm is defined in the configured list of allowed integrity protection algorithms in the eNB (TS 33.401 [18]), the eNB shall take it into use and ignore the keys received in the AS Security Information IE.
The HANDOVER REQUEST message shall contain the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE, if available.
If the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall store this information and the target eNB should use the information as defined in TS 36.300 [15].
Upon reception of UE History Information IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall collect the information defined as mandatory in the UE History Information IE and shall, if supported, collect the information defined as optional in the UE History Information IE, for as long as the UE stays in one of its cells, and store the collected information to be used for future handover preparations.
Upon reception of the UE History Information from the UE IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store the collected information to be used for future handover preparations.
If the Mobility Information IE is provided in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store this information and use it as defined in TS 36.300 [15]. The target eNB shall, if supported, store the C-RNTI of the source cell received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message.
If the Expected UE Behaviour IE is provided in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store this information and may use it to determine the RRC connection time.
If the ProSe Authorized IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message and it contains one or more IEs set to "authorized", the eNB shall, if supported, consider that the UE is authorized for the relevant ProSe service(s).
If the V2X Services Authorized IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message and it contains one or more IEs set to "authorized", the eNB shall, if supported, consider that the UE is authorized for the relevant service(s).
If the UE Context Reference at the SeNB IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target eNB may use it as specified in TS 36.300 [15]. In this case, the source eNB may expect the target eNB to include the UE Context Kept Indicator IE set to "True" in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, which shall use this information as specified in TS 36.300 [15]. If the UE Context Reference at the WT IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB may use it as specified in TS 36.300 [15]. In this case, the source eNB may expect the target eNB to include the WT UE Context Kept Indicator IE set to "True" in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message; the source eNB shall use this information as specified in TS 36.300 [15].
If the Bearer Type IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message and is set to “non IP”, then the target eNB shall not perform header compression for the concerned E-RAB.
If the UE Sidelink Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, use it for the concerned UE’s sidelink communication in network scheduled mode for V2X services.
8.2.1.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.3-1: Handover Preparation, unsuccessful operation
If the target eNB does not admit at least one non-GBR E-RAB, or a failure occurs during the Handover Preparation, the target eNB shall send the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source eNB. The message shall contain the Cause IE with an appropriate value.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing RRC Context IE that does not include required information as specified in TS 36.331 [9], the target eNB shall send the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source eNB.
Interactions with Handover Cancel procedure:
If there is no response from the target eNB to the HANDOVER REQUEST message before timer TRELOCprep expires in the source eNB, the source eNB should cancel the Handover Preparation procedure towards the target eNB by initiating the Handover Cancel procedure with the appropriate value for the Cause IE. The source eNB shall ignore any HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE or HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message received after the initiation of the Handover Cancel procedure and remove any reference and release any resources related to the concerned X2 UE-associated signalling.
8.2.1.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing multiple E-RAB ID IEs (in the E-RABs To Be Setup List IE) set to the same value, the target eNB shall not admit the corresponding E-RABs.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing a E-RAB Level QoS Parameters IE which contains a QCI IE indicating a GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the GBR QoS Information IE, the target eNB shall not admit the corresponding E-RAB. 
If the supported algorithms for encryption defined in the Encryption Algorithms IE in the UE Security Capabilities IE in the UE Context Information IE, plus the mandated support of EEA0 in all UEs (TS 33.401 [18]), do not match any algorithms defined in the configured list of allowed encryption algorithms in the target eNB (TS 33.401 [18]), the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the supported algorithms for integrity defined in the Integrity Protection Algorithms IE in the UE Security Capabilities IE in the UE Context Information IE, plus the mandated support of the EIA0 algorithm in all UEs (TS 33.401 [18]), do not match any algorithms defined in the configured list of allowed integrity protection algorithms in the eNB (TS 33.401 [18]), the eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message. 
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message which does not contain the Handover Restriction List IE, and the PLMN to be used cannot be determined otherwise, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing the Handover Restriction List IE, and the serving PLMN is not supported by the target cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message which does not contain the CSG Membership Status IE, and the target cell is a hybrid cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the target cell is a CSG cell and the target eNB has not received any CSG ID of the source cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the target cell is a CSG cell with a different CSG from the source cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
8.2.2		SN Status Transfer
8.2.2.1	General
The purpose of the SN Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the uplink PDCP SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status either, from the source to the target eNB during an X2 handover, or between the eNBs involved in dual connectivity and/or LWA, for each respective E-RAB for which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation applies.
If the SN Status Transfer procedure is applied in the course of dual connectivity and/or LWA, in the subsequent specification text
-	the behaviour of the eNB from which the E-RAB context is transferred, i.e., the eNB involved in dual connectivity and/or LWA from which data forwarding, is specified by the behaviour of the "source eNB",
-	the behaviour of the eNB to which the E-RAB context is transferred, i.e., the eNB involved in dual connectivity and/or LWA to which data is forwarded, is specified by the behaviour of the "target eNB".
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.2.2	Successful Operation


Figure 8.2.2.2-1: SN Status Transfer, successful operation
The source eNB initiates the procedure by stop assigning PDCP SNs to downlink SDUs and stop delivering UL SDUs towards the EPC and sending the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target eNB at the time point when it considers the transmitter/receiver status to be frozen. The target eNB using Full Configuration for this handover as per TS 36.300 [15] shall ignore the information received in this message.
The E-RABs Subject To Status Transfer List IE included in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message contains the E-RAB ID(s) corresponding to the E-RAB(s) for which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation shall be applied.
If the source eNB includes in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, the information on the missing and received uplink SDUs in the Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs IE or Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs Extended IE or Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs for PDCP SN Length 18 IE for each E-RAB for which the source eNB has accepted the request from the target eNB for uplink forwarding, then the target eNB may use it in a Status Report message sent to the UE over the radio.
For each E-RAB for which the DL COUNT Value IE is received in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall use it to mark with the value contained in the PDCP-SN IE of this IE the first downlink packet for which there is no PDCP SN yet assigned. If the DL COUNT Value Extended IE or DL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18 IE is included in the E-RABs Subject To Status Transfer Item IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use the value contained in the PDCP-SN Extended IE of the DL COUNT Value Extended IE or PDCP-SN Length 18 IE of the DL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18 IE instead of the value contained in the PDCP-SN IE of the DL COUNT Value IE.
For each E-RAB for which the UL COUNT Value IE is received in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall not deliver any uplink packet which has a PDCP SN lower than the value contained in the PDCP-SN IE of this IE. If the UL COUNT Value Extended IE or UL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18 IE is included in the E-RABs Subject To Status Transfer Item IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use the value contained in the PDCP-SN Extended IE of the UL COUNT Value Extended IE or PDCP-SN Length 18 IE of the UL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18 IE instead of the value contained in the PDCP-SN IE of the UL COUNT Value IE.
8.2.2.3	Abnormal Conditions
If the target eNB receives this message for a UE for which no prepared handover exists at the target eNB, the target eNB shall ignore the message.
8.2.3	UE Context Release
8.2.3.1	General
For handover, the UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target eNB to indicate to the source eNB that radio and control plane resources for the associated UE context are allowed to be released.
For dual connectivity, UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the MeNB to finally release the UE context at the SeNB. For dual connectivity specific mobility scenarios specified in TS 36.300 [15] only resources related to the UE-associated signalling connection between the MeNB and the SeNB are released.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.3.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: UE Context Release, successful operation for handover


Figure 8.2.3.2-2: UE Context Release, successful operation for dual connectivity
Handover
The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target eNB. By sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the target eNB informs the source eNB of Handover success and triggers the release of resources. 
Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the source eNB may release radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE context. For E-RABs for which data forwarding has been performed, the source eNB should continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets are received at the source eNB from the EPC or the source eNB buffer has not been emptied (an implementation dependent mechanism decides that data forwarding can be stopped). When the eNB supporting L-GW function for SIPTO@LN operation releases radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE context, it shall also request using intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW to release the SIPTO@LN PDN connection as defined in TS 23.401 [12].
Dual Connectivity
The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the MeNB. By sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the MeNB informs the SeNB that the UE Context can be removed.
Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the SeNB may release radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE context. For E-RABs for which data forwarding has been performed, the SeNB should continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets are received at the SeNB from the EPC or the SeNB buffer has not been emptied (an implementation dependent mechanism decides that data forwarding can be stopped). The SeNB supporting L-GW function for LIPA operation shall also request using intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW to release the LIPA PDN connection as defined in TS 23.401 [12]. If the SIPTO Bearer Deactivation Indication IE is received in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the SeNB supporting L-GW function for SIPTO@LN operation shall also request using intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW to release the SIPTO@LN PDN connection as defined in TS 23.401 [12].
Interaction with the MeNB initiated SeNB Release procedure:
The SeNB may receive the SENB RELEASE REQUEST message including the UE Context Kept Indicator IE set to “True”, upon which the SeNB shall, if supported, only release the resources related to the UE-associated signalling connection between the MeNB and the SeNB, as specified in TS 36.300 [15].
8.2.3.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.2.3.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the UE Context Release procedure is not initiated towards the source eNB from any prepared eNB before the expiry of the timer TX2RELOCoverall, the source eNB shall request the MME to release the UE context. 
If the UE returns to source eNB before the reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message or the expiry of the timer TX2RELOCoverall, the source eNB shall stop the TX2RELOCoverall and continue to serve the UE.
8.2.4	Handover Cancel
8.2.4.1	General
The Handover Cancel procedure is used to enable a source eNB to cancel an ongoing handover preparation or an already prepared handover.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.4.2-1: Handover Cancel, successful operation
The source eNB initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER CANCEL message to the target eNB. The source eNB shall indicate the reason for cancelling the handover by means of an appropriate cause value.
At the reception of the HANDOVER CANCEL message, the target eNB shall remove any reference to, and release any resources previously reserved to the concerned UE context.
The New eNB UE X2AP ID IE and, if available, the New eNB UE X2AP ID Extension IE shall be included if it has been obtained from the target eNB. 
8.2.4.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.2.4.4	Abnormal Conditions
Should the HANDOVER CANCEL message refer to a context that does not exist, the target eNB shall ignore the message.
8.3		Global Procedures
8.3.1		Load Indication
8.3.1.1	General
The purpose of the Load Indication procedure is to transfer load and interference co-ordination information between eNBs controlling intra-frequency neighboring cells, and additionally between eNBs controlling inter-frequency neighboring cells for TDD.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.1.2-1: Load Indication, successful operation
An eNB1 initiates the procedure by sending LOAD INFORMATION message to a peer eNB2.
If the UL Interference Overload Indication IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, it indicates the interference level experienced by the indicated cell on all resource blocks, per PRB. If the Extended UL Interference Overload Info IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, the UL Interference Overload Indication IE indicates the interference level experienced by the indicated cell ignoring the UL subframe(s) represented as value “1” in the Associated Subframes IE. The receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting its scheduling policy and shall consider the received UL Interference Overload Indication IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.
If the UL High Interference Indication IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, it indicates, per PRB, the occurrence of high interference sensitivity, as seen from the sending eNB. The receiving eNB should try to avoid scheduling cell edge UEs in its cells for the concerned PRBs. The Target Cell ID IE received within the UL High Interference Information IE group in the LOAD INFORMATION message indicates the cell for which the corresponding UL High Interference Indication is meant. The receiving eNB shall consider the value of the UL High Interference Information IE group valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update.
If the Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP) IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, it indicates, per PRB or per subframe per PRB (Enhanced RNTP), whether downlink transmission power is lower than the value indicated by the RNTP Threshold IE. If the Enhanced RNTP IE is included in the Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP) IE, it additionally indicates whether the downlink transmission power is lower than the value specified by the RNTP High Power Threshold IE. The receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting its scheduling policy and shall consider the received Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP) IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update. If the Enhanced RNTP IE included in the Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP) IE is present, the receiving eNB shall consider the received Enhanced RNTP IE value valid starting from the subframe indicated by the Start SFN IE and Start Subframe Number IE, if present.
If the ABS Information IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION message, the ABS Pattern Info IE indicates the subframes designated as almost blank subframes by the sending eNB for the purpose of interference coordination. The receiving eNB may take such information into consideration when scheduling UEs.
The receiving eNB may use the Measurement Subset IE received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, for the configuration of specific measurements towards the UE.
The receiving eNB shall consider the received information as immediately applicable. The receiving eNB shall consider the value of the ABS Information IE valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update. 
If an ABS indicated in the ABS pattern info IE coincides with a MBSFN subframe, the receiving eNB shall consider that the subframe is designated as almost blank subframe by the sending eNB.
If the Invoke Indication IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION message, it indicates which type of information the sending eNB would like the receiving eNB to send back. The receiving eNB may take such request into account.
If the Invoke Indication IE is set to "ABS Information", it indicates the sending eNB would like the receiving eNB to initiate the Load Indication procedure, with the LOAD INFORMATION message containing the ABS Information IE indicating non-zero ABS patterns in the relevant cells. If the Invoke Indication IE is set to "Start NAICS Information", it indicates the sending eNB would like the receiving eNB to initiate the Load Indication procedure with the LOAD INFORMATION message containing the Dynamic DL transmission information IE. The first time the Dynamic DL transmission information IE is signalled after receiving the Invoke Indication IE set to "Start NAICS Information", all the NAICS parameters in the NAICS Information IE shall be included. If the Invoke Indication IE is set to "Stop NAICS Information", it indicates the sending eNB does not need NAICS information and therefore the receiving eNB should stop signalling NAICS parameters for the concerned cell. 
If the NAICS Information IE is set to "NAICS Active", the receiving eNB may use it for the configuration of DL interference mitigation assistance information towards the UE. Information included in the NAICS Information IE shall replace corresponding NAICS information existing at the receiver. If the NAICS Information IE is set to "NAICS Inactive", the receiving eNB shall consider the existing NAICS information as invalid.
If the Intended UL-DL Configuration IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION message, it indicates the UL-DL configuration intended to be used by the indicated cell. The receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting its scheduling policy and shall consider the received Intended UL-DL Configuration IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.
If the Extended UL Interference Overload Info IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, the Extended UL Interference Overload Indication IE indicates the interference level experienced by the indicated cell on all resource blocks, per PRB, in the UL subframe(s) which is represented as value “1” in the Associated Subframes IE. The receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting its scheduling policy and shall consider the received Extended UL Interference Overload Info IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.
If the CoMP Information IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION message, the receiving eNB may take the IE into account for RRM. The receiving eNB shall consider the CoMP Information IE valid starting in the subframe indicated by the Start SFN IE and Start Subframe Number IE, if present. If the Start SFN IE and Start Subframe Number IE are not present, then the receiving eNB shall consider the CoMP Information IE as immediately valid. The receiving eNB shall consider the CoMP Information IE valid until an update of the same IE, received in a new LOAD INFORMATION message, is considered valid.

8.3.2	Error Indication
8.3.2.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by an eNB to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.2.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.2.2-1: Error Indication, successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the node detecting the error situation.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by UE associated signalling, in the course of handover signalling and signalling for dual connectivity, the Old eNB UE X2AP ID IE and the New eNB UE X2AP ID IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If one or both of Old eNB UE X2AP ID IE and New eNB UE X2AP ID IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "unknown Old eNB UE X2AP ID", "unknown New eNB UE X2AP ID" or "unknown pair of UE X2AP ID".
If the UE-associated signalling connection is identified by extended eNB UE X2AP IDs the specification text above is applicable for the UE X2AP ID Extension accordingly.

8.3.3	X2 Setup
8.3.3.1	General
The purpose of the X2 Setup procedure is to exchange application level configuration data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over the X2 interface. This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received. This procedure also resets the X2 interface like a Reset procedure would do.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.3.2	Successful Operation


Figure 8.3.3.2-1: X2 Setup, successful operation
An eNB1 initiates the procedure by sending the X2 SETUP REQUEST message to a candidate eNB2. The candidate eNB2 replies with the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The initiating eNB1 shall transfer the complete list of its served cells and, if available, a list of supported GU Group Ids to the candidate eNB2. The candidate eNB2 shall reply with the complete list of its served cells and shall include, if available, a list of supported GU Group Ids in the reply.
If a cell is switched off for energy savings reasons, it should be activated before initiating or responding to the X2 Setup procedure and shall still be included in the list of served cells.
The initiating eNB1 may include the Neighbour Information IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB2 may also include the Neighbour Information IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The Neighbour Information IE shall only include E-UTRAN cells that are direct neighbours of cells in the reporting eNB. A direct neighbour of one cell of a given eNB may be any cell belonging to an eNB that is a neighbour of that given eNB cell e.g. even if the cell has not been reported by a UE. The initiating eNB1 may include the TAC IE with the Neighbour Information IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB2 may also include the TAC IE with the Neighbour Information IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.300 [15].
The initiating eNB1 may include the Number of Antenna Ports IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB2 may also include the Number of Antenna Ports IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.331 [9].
The initiating eNB1 may include the PRACH Configuration IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB2 may also include the PRACH Configuration IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use this information for RACH optimisation.
The initiating eNB1 may include the MBSFN Subframe Info IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB2 may also include the MBSFN Subframe Info IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.331 [9].
For each CSG cell or hybrid cell served by the initiating eNB1 the X2 SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the CSG ID IE. For each CSG cell or hybrid cell served by the candidate eNB2 the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message shall contain the CSG ID IE. The eNB receiving the IE shall take this information into account when further deciding whether X2 handover between the source cell and the target cell may be performed.
The initiating eNB1 may include the MBMS Service Area Identity List IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB2 may also include the MBMS Service Area Identity List IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.300 [15].
For each cell served by the initiating eNB1 the X2 SETUP REQUEST message may contain the MultibandInfoList IE and may also contain the FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE. For each cell served by the candidate eNB2 the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message may contain the MultibandInfoList IE and may also contain the FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE. The eNB receiving the MultibandInfoList IE shall, if supported, take this information into account when further deciding whether subsequent mobility actions between the source cell and the target cell may be performed, and use this IE and the FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE, if received, as specified in TS 36.331 [9].
The initiating eNB1 may include the LHN ID IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB2 may also include LHN ID IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.300 [15].

8.3.3.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.3.3-1: X2 Setup, unsuccessful operation
If the candidate eNB2 cannot accept the setup it shall respond with an X2 SETUP FAILURE message with appropriate cause value.
If the X2 SETUP FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the initiating eNB1 shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the X2 Setup procedure towards the same eNB2.
8.3.3.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the first message received for a specific TNL association is not an X2 SETUP REQUEST, X2 SETUP RESPONSE, or X2 SETUP FAILURE message then this shall be treated as a logical error.
If the initiating eNB1 does not receive either X2 SETUP RESPONSE message or X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the eNB1 may reinitiate the X2 Setup procedure towards the same eNB, provided that the content of the new X2 SETUP REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged X2 SETUP REQUEST message.
If the initiating eNB1 receives an X2 SETUP REQUEST message from the peer entity on the same X2 interface:
-	In case the eNB1 answers with an X2 SETUP RESPONSE message and receives a subsequent X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the eNB1 shall consider the X2 interface as non operational and the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated according to sub clause 8.3.3.3.
-	In case the eNB1 answers with an X2 SETUP FAILURE message and receives a subsequent X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, the eNB1 shall ignore the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message and consider the X2 interface as non operational.
8.3.4	Reset
8.3.4.1	General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to align the resources in eNB1 and eNB2 in the event of an abnormal failure. The procedure resets the X2 interface. This procedure doesn’t affect the application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the X2 Setup procedure.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.4.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.4.2-1: Reset, successful operation
The procedure is initiated with a RESET REQUEST message sent from the eNB1 to the eNB2. Upon receipt of this message, eNB2 shall abort any other ongoing procedures over X2 between eNB1 and eNB2. The eNB2 shall delete all the context information related to the eNB1, except the application level configuration data exchanged during the X2 Setup or eNB Configuration Update procedures, and release the corresponding resources. After completion of release of the resources, the eNB2 shall respond with a RESET RESPONSE message.
8.3.4.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Void.
8.3.4.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the RESET REQUEST message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except another Reset procedure) on the same X2 interface shall be aborted.
If Reset procedure is ongoing and the eNB2 receives the RESET REQUEST message from the peer entity on the same X2 interface, the eNB2 shall respond with the RESET RESPONSE message as described in 8.3.4.2.
If the initiating eNB does not receive RESET RESPONSE message, the eNB1 may reinitiate the Reset procedure towards the same eNB, provided that the content of the new RESET REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged RESET REQUEST message.
8.3.5	eNB Configuration Update 
8.3.5.1	General
The purpose of the eNB Configuration Update procedure is to update application level configuration data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over the X2 interface.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.5.2	Successful Operation


Figure 8.3.5.2-1: eNB Configuration Update, successful operation
An eNB1 initiates the procedure by sending an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to a peer eNB2 . Such message shall include an appropriate set of up-to-date configuration data, including, but not limited to, the complete lists of added, modified and deleted served cells, that eNB1 has just taken into operational use.
Upon reception of an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 shall update the information for eNB1 as follows:
Update of Served Cell Information:
-	If Served Cells To Add IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 shall add cell information according to the information in the Served Cell Information IE.
-	If Number of Antenna Ports IE is contained in the Served Cell Information IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 may use this information according to TS 36.331 [9].
-	If the PRACH Configuration IE is contained in the Served Cell Information IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB receiving the IE may use this information for RACH optimisation.
-	If Served Cells To Modify IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 shall modify information of cell indicated by Old ECGI IE according to the information in the Served Cell Information IE.
-	If MBSFN Subframe Info IE is contained in the Served Cell Information IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 may use this information according to TS 36.331 [9]. If a MBSFN subframe indicated in the MBSFN Subframe Info IE coincides with an ABS, the eNB2 shall consider that the subframe is designated as ABS by the sending eNB.
-	If BandwidthReducedSI IE is contained in the Served Cell Information IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 may use this information to determine a suitable target in case of subsequent outgoing mobility involving BL UEs or UEs requiring CE.
	When either served cell information or neighbour information of an existing served cell in eNB1 need to be updated, the whole list of neighbouring cells, if any, shall be contained in the Neighbour Information IE.
	If the Deactivation Indication IE is contained in Served Cells To Modify IE, it indicates that the concerned cell was switched off to lower energy consumption.
	The eNB2 shall overwrite the served cell information and the whole list of neighbour cell information for the affected served cell.
-	If Served Cells To Delete IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 shall delete information of cell indicated by Old ECGI IE.
-	If MBMS Service Area Identity List IE is contained in the Served Cell Information IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.300 [15].
	When the MBMS Service Area Identities of a cell in eNB1 need to be updated, the whole list of MBMS Service Area Identities of the affected cell shall be contained in the Served Cell Information IE.
Update of GU Group Id List:
-	If GU Group Id To Add List IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 shall add the GU Group Id to its GU Group Id List.
-	If GU Group Id To Delete List IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 shall remove the GU Group Id from its GU Group Id List.
If Neighbour Information IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB2 may use this information to update its neighbour cell relations, or use it for other functions, like PCI selection. The Neighbour Information IE shall only include E-UTRAN cells that are direct neighbours of cells in the reporting eNB. A direct neighbour of one cell of a given eNB may be any cell belonging to an eNB that is a neighbour of that given eNB cell e.g. even if that cell has not been reported by a UE. The Neighbour Information IE may contain the TAC IE of the included cells. The receiving eNB may use TAC IE, as described in TS 36.300 [15].
After successful update of requested information, eNB2 shall reply with the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to inform the initiating eNB1 that the requested update of application data was performed successfully. In case the peer eNB2 receives an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE without any IE except for Message Type IE it shall reply with ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message without performing any updates to the existing configuration.
The eNB1 may initiate a further eNB Configuration Update procedure only after a previous eNB Configuration Update procedure has been completed.
For each cell served by the initiating  eNB1 the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message may contain the MultibandInfoList IE and may also contain the FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE. The eNB receiving the MultibandInfoList IE shall, if supported, take this information into account when further deciding whether subsequent mobility actions between the source cell and the target cell may be performed, and use this IE and the FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE, if received, as specified in TS 36.331 [9].
If the Coverage Modification List IE is present, eNB2 may use the information in the Cell Coverage State IE to identify the cell deployment configuration enabled by eNB1 and for configuring the mobility towards the cell(s) indicated by the ECGI IE, as described in TS 36.300 [15]. If the Cell Deployment Status Indicator IE is present in the Coverage Modification List IE, the eNB2 shall consider the cell deployment configuration of the cell to be modified as the next planned configuration and shall remove any planned configuration stored for this cell. If the Cell Deployment Status Indicator IE is present and the Cell Replacing Info IE contains non-empty cell list, the eNB2 may use this list to avoid connection or re-establishment failures during the reconfiguration, e.g. consider the cells in the list as possible alternative handover targets. If the Cell Deployment Status Indicator IE is not present, the eNB2 shall consider the cell deployment configuration of cell to be modified as activated and replace any previous configuration for the cells indicated in the Coverage Modification List IE.
Interaction with the eNB Configuration Update procedure:
If an eNB2 which has not stored a FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE received from eNB1, but has signaled a FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE to eNB1 after the TNL association has become available, receives an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message from eNB1 containing the FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE, the eNB2 shall initiate the eNB Configuration Update procedure towards eNB1 including the FreqBandIndicatorPriority IE.
8.3.5.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.5.3-1: eNB Configuration Update, unsuccessful operation
If the eNB2 can not accept the update it shall respond with an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the Time To Wait IE the eNB1 shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the eNB Configuration Update procedure towards the same eNB2. Both nodes shall continue to operate the X2 with their existing configuration data.
8.3.5.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB1 after initiating eNB Configuration Update procedure receives neither ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message nor ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the eNB1 may reinitiate the eNB Configuration Update procedure towards the same eNB2, provided that the content of the new ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
8.3.6	Resource Status Reporting Initiation
8.3.6.1	General
This procedure is used by an eNB to request the reporting of load measurements to another eNB.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.6.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.6.2-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, successful operation
The procedure is initiated with a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message sent from eNB1 to eNB2. Upon receipt, eNB2:
-	shall initiate the requested measurement according to the parameters given in the request in case the Registration Request IE set to "start"; or
-	shall stop all cells measurements and terminate the reporting in case the Registration Request IE is set to “stop"; or
-	if supported, stop cell measurements and terminate the reporting for cells indicated in the Cell To Report IE list, in case the Registration Request IE is set to "partial stop"; or
-	if supported, add cells indicated in the Cell To Report IE list to the measurements initiated before for the given measurement IDs, in case the Registration Request IE is set to "add".
If the eNB2 received a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, which includes the Registration Request IE set to "stop", the Cell To Report IE list shall be ignored.
If the Registration Request IE is set to "start" then the Report Characteristics IE shall be included in RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message. The eNB2 shall ignore the Report Characteristics IE, if the Registration Request IE is not set to "start".
The Report Characteristics IE indicates the type of objects eNB2 shall perform measurements on. For each cell, the eNB2 shall include in the RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message:
-	the Radio Resource Status IE, if the first bit, “PRB Periodic” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;
-	the S1 TNL Load Indicator IE, if the second bit, “TNL Load Ind Periodic” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;
-	the Hardware Load Indicator IE, if the third bit, “HW Load Ind Periodic” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;
-	the Composite Available Capacity Group IE, if the fourth bit, “Composite Available Capacity Periodic” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1. If Cell Capacity Class Value IE is included within the Composite Available Capacity Group IE, this IE is used to assign weights to the available capacity indicated in the Capacity Value IE;
-	the ABS Status IE, if the fifth bit, “ABS Status Periodic” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1 and eNB1 had indicated the ABS pattern to eNB2;
-	the RSRP Measurement Report List IE, if the sixth bit, “RSRP Measurement Report Periodic” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;
-	the CSI Report IE, if the seventh bit, “CSI Report Periodic” of the Report Characteristics IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1.
If the Reporting Periodicity IE is included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, eNB2 shall use its value as the time interval between two subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE messages that include the Radio Resource Status IE, S1 TNL Load Indicator IE, Hardware Load Indicator IE, Composite Available Capacity Group IE, or ABS Status IE.
If the Reporting Periodicity of RSRP Measurement Report IE is included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, eNB2 shall use its value as the minimum time interval between two subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE messages that include the RSRP Measurement Report List IE.
If the Reporting Periodicity of CSI Report IE is included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, eNB2 shall use its value as the minimum time interval between two subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE messages that include the CSI Report IE.
If eNB2 is capable to provide all requested resource status information, it shall initiate the measurement as requested by eNB1, and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.
If eNB2 is capable to provide some but not all of the requested resource status information and the Partial Success Indicator IE is present in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, it shall initiate the measurement for the admitted measurement objects and include the Measurement Initiation Result IE in the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.
8.3.6.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.6.3-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, unsuccessful operation 
If none of the requested measurements can be initiated, eNB2 shall send a RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message. The Cause IE shall be set to an appropriate value e.g. "Measurement Temporarily not Available" or "Measurement not Supported For The Object" for each requested measurement object. The eNB may use the Complete Failure Cause Information IE to enhance the failure cause information per measurement in the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message.
8.3.6.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the initiating eNB1 does not receive either RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message or RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the eNB1 may reinitiate the Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure towards the same eNB, provided that the content of the new RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message.
If the initiating eNB1 receives the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message including the Measurement Initiation Result IE containing no admitted measurements, the eNB1 shall consider the procedure as failed.
If the Report Characteristics IE bitmap is set to "0" (all bits are set to "0") in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message then eNB2 shall initiate a RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "ReportCharacteristicsEmpty".
If the Reporting Periodicity IE value is not specified when at least one of the bits of the Report Characteristics IE, for which semantics is specified, other than the sixth or seventh bit, is set to 1 then eNB2 shall initiate a RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "NoReportPeriodicity".
If the Reporting Periodicity of RSRP Measurement Report IE value is not specified when the sixth bit of the Report Characteristics IE is set to 1, then eNB2 shall initiate the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message and the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "NoReportPeriodicity".
If the Reporting Periodicity of CSI Report IE value is not specified when the seventh bit of the Report Characteristics IE is set to 1, then eNB2 shall initiate the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message and the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "NoReportPeriodicity".
If the eNB2 received a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message which includes the Registration Request IE set to "start" and the eNB1Measurement ID IE corresponding to an existing on-going load measurement reporting, then eNB2 shall initiate a RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "ExistingMeasurementID".
If the Registration Request IE is set to "stop", "partial stop" or "add" and the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message does not contain eNB2 Measurement ID IE, eNB2 shall consider the procedure as failed and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "Unknown eNB Measurement ID".
If the Registration Request IE is set to "partial stop" and the Cell To Report IE contains cells that have not been initiated for the reporting before, eNB2 shall consider the procedure as failed and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "Cell not Available". If the Registration Request IE is set to "add" and the Cell To Report IE contains cells that have been initiated for the reporting before, eNB2 shall consider the procedure as failed and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. "Cell not Available".
8.3.7	Resource Status Reporting
8.3.7.1	General
This procedure is initiated by eNB2 to report the result of measurements admitted by eNB2 following a successful Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.7.2-1: Resource Status Reporting, successful operation
The eNB2 shall report the results of the admitted measurements in RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message. The admitted measurements are the measurements that were successfully initiated during the preceding Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure, and thus not reported in the Measurement Failed Report Characteristics IE for the concerned cell in the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.
If the eNB1 receives the RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message which includes the UE ID IE in the RSRP Measurement Report List IE, the eNB1 may use the UE ID IE to link the associated RSRP measurement report with other measurement results (e.g. CSI reports, RSRP measurement reports) of the same UE.
If the CSI Report IE including the CSI Process Configuration Index IE is received, eNB1 shall interpret this IE as an index identifying one of the CSI process configurations that can be configured for all UEs within the cell where the CSI measurements were collected. For all UEs within the cell, the maximum number of CSI process configurations is given by the maximum value of the CSI Process Configuration Index IE.
If the eNB1 receives the RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message, which includes the Cell Reporting Indicator IE set to "stop request" in one or more items of the Cell Measurement Result IE, the eNB1 should initialise the Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure to remove all or some of the corresponding cells from the measurement.
8.3.7.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.3.7.4	Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB1 receives a RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message which includes the ABS Status IE, and all bits in the Usable ABS Pattern Info IE are set to '0', the eNB1 shall ignore the DL ABS Status IE.
8.3.8	Mobility Settings Change
8.3.8.1	General
This procedure enables an eNB to negotiate the handover trigger settings with a peer eNB controlling neighbouring cells.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.8.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.8.2-1: Mobility Settings Change, successful operation 
The procedure is initiated with a MOBILITY CHANGE REQUEST message sent from eNB1 to eNB2. 
Upon receipt, eNB2 shall evaluate if the proposed eNB2 handover trigger modification may be accepted. If eNB2 is able to successfully complete the request it shall reply with MOBILITY CHANGE ACKNOWLEDGE.
8.3.8.3	Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.8.3-1: Mobility Settings Change, unsuccessful operation 
If the requested parameter modification is refused by the eNB2, or if the eNB2 is not able to complete the procedure, the eNB2 shall send a MOBILITY CHANGE FAILURE message with the Cause IE set to an appropriate value. The eNB2 may include eNB2 Mobility Parameters Modification Range IE in MOBILITY CHANGE FAILURE message, for example in cases when the proposed change is out of permitted range.
8.3.8.4	Abnormal Conditions
Void.
8.3.9	Radio Link Failure Indication
8.3.9.1	General
The purpose of the Radio Link Failure Indication procedure is to transfer information regarding RRC re-establishment attempts, or received RLF Reports, between eNBs. The signalling takes place from the eNB at which a re-establishment attempt is made, or an RLF Report is received, to an eNB to which the UE concerned may have previously been attached prior to the connection failure. This may aid the detection of radio link failure and handover failure cases (TS 36.300 [15]).
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.9.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.9.2-1: Radio Link Failure Indication, successful operation
eNB2 initiates the procedure by sending the RLF INDICATION message to eNB1 following a re-establishment attempt or an RLF Report reception from a UE at eNB2, when eNB2 considers that the UE may have previously suffered a connection failure at a cell controlled by eNB1.
eNB2 may include the ShortMAC-I IE in the RLF INDICATION message, e.g., in order to aid the eNB1 to resolve a potential PCI confusion situation or to aid the eNB1 to identify the UE.
eNB2 may include the UE RLF Report Container IE and optionally also the UE RLF Report Container for extended bands IE in the RLF INDICATION message, which may be used by the eNB1 to determine the nature of the failure. If the UE RLF Report Container IE is included in the RLF INDICATION message sent after successful re-establishment, the eNB2 shall use the Re-establishment Cell ECGI IE in the RLF INDICATION message to indicate the ECGI of the cell where the re-establishment was successful.
eNB2 may include the RRC Conn Setup Indicator IE in the RLF INDICATION message, which indicates that the RLF Report is retrieved after an RRC connection setup or an incoming successful handover.
If the RRC Conn Setup Indicator IE is present in the RLF INDICATION message, the eNB1 shall ignore the values in the Failure cell PCI IE, Re-establishment cell ECGI IE, C-RNTI IE and ShortMAC-I IE.
eNB2 may include the RRC Conn Reestab Indicator IE in the RLF INDICATION message, which may be used by the eNB1 to determine where the failure occurred.

8.3.10	Handover Report
8.3.10.1	General
The purpose of the Handover Report procedure is to transfer mobility related information between eNBs.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.3.10.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.10.2-1: Handover Report, successful operation 
An eNB initiates the procedure by sending an HANDOVER REPORT message to another eNB. By sending the message eNB1 indicates to eNB2 that a mobility-related problem was detected.
If the Handover Report Type IE is set to "HO too early" or "HO to wrong cell", then the eNB1 indicates to eNB2 that, following a successful handover from a cell of eNB2 to a cell of eNB1, a radio link failure occurred and the UE attempted RRC Re-establishment either at the original cell of eNB2 (Handover Too Early), or at another cell (Handover to Wrong Cell). The detection of Handover Too Early and Handover to Wrong Cell events is made according to TS 36.300 [15].
If the UE-related information is available in eNB1, the eNB1 should include in HANDOVER REPORT message:
-	the Mobility Information IE, if the Mobility Information IE was sent for this handover from eNB2;
-	the Source cell C-RNTI IE.
If received, the eNB2 uses the above information according to TS 36.300 [15].
If the UE RLF Report received from the eNB sending the RLF INDICATION message, as described in TS 36.300 [15], is available, the eNB1 may also include it in the HANDOVER REPORT as UE RLF Report Container IE and optionally also UE RLF Report Container for extended bands IE.
If the Handover Report Type IE is set to "InterRAT ping-pong", then the eNB1 indicates to eNB2 that a completed handover from a cell of eNB2 to a cell in other RAT might have resulted in an inter-RAT ping-pong and the UE was successfully handed over to a cell of eNB1 (indicated with Failure cell ECGI IE).
The report contains the source and target cells, and cause of the handover. If the Handover Report Type IE is set to "HO to wrong cell", then the Re-establishment cell ECGI IE shall be included in the HANDOVER REPORT message. If the Handover Report Type IE is set to "InterRAT ping-pong", then the Target cell in UTRAN IE shall be included in the HANDOVER REPORT message.

When the MeNB has initiated the procedure and did not include the SeNB UE X2AP ID IE the MeNB shall regard the resources for the UE at the SeNB as being fully released.
8.6.6	SeNB initiated SeNB Release
8.6.6.1	General
This procedure is triggered by the SeNB to initiate the release of the resources for a specific UE.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.6.6.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.6.2-1: SeNB initiated SeNB Release, successful operation.
The SeNB initiates the procedure by sending the SENB RELEASE REQUIRED message to the MeNB.
Upon reception of the SENB RELEASE REQUIRED message, the MeNB replies with the SENB RELEASE CONFIRM message. For each E-RAB configured with the SCG bearer option, the MeNB may include the DL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE and the UL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE within the E-RABs To Be Released Item IE to indicate that it requests data forwarding of uplink and downlink packets to be performed for that bearer. For each E-RAB configured with the split bearer option, the MeNB may include the DL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE within the E-RABs To Be Released Item IE to indicate that it requests data forwarding of downlink packets to be performed for that bearer.
The SeNB may start data forwarding and stop providing user data to the UE upon reception of the SENB RELEASE CONFIRM message,
8.6.6.3	Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
8.6.6.4	Abnormal Conditions

8.6.7	SeNB Counter Check
8.6.7.1	General
This procedure is initiated by the SeNB to request the MeNB to execute a counter check procedure to verify the value of the PDCP COUNTs associated with SCG bearers established in the SeNB.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.6.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.7.2-1: SeNB Counter Check procedure, successful operation.
The SeNB initiates the procedure by sending the SENB COUNTER CHECK REQUEST message to the MeNB.
Upon reception of the SENB COUNTER CHECK REQUEST message, the MeNB may perform the RRC counter check procedure as defined in TS 33.401 [18].

9.2	Information Element definitions
9.2.0	General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.
9.2.1	GTP Tunnel Endpoint
The GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE identifies an X2 transport bearer or the S-GW endpoint of the S1 transport bearer associated to an E-RAB. It contains a Transport Layer Address and a GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier. The Transport Layer Address is an IP address to be used for the X2 user plane transport (see TS 36.424 [8]) or for the S1 user plane transport (see TS 36.414 [19]). The GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier is to be used for the user plane transport between eNB and the S-GW or between eNBs.

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the concerned capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the concerned capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
Cell not Available
The concerned cell is not available.
Handover Desirable for Radio Reasons
The reason for requesting handover is radio related.
Handover Target not Allowed
Handover to the indicated target cell is not allowed for the UE in question
Invalid MME Group ID
The target eNB doesn’t belong to the same pool area of the source eNB i.e. S1 handovers should be attempted instead.
No Radio Resources Available in Target Cell
The target cell doesn’t have sufficient radio resources available.
Partial Handover
Provides a reason for the handover cancellation. The target eNB did not admit all E-RABs included in the HANDOVER REQUEST and the source eNB estimated service continuity for the UE would be better by not proceeding with handover towards this particular target eNB.
Reduce Load in Serving Cell
Load in serving cell needs to be reduced. When applied to handover preparation, it indicates the handover is triggered due to load balancing.
Resource Optimisation Handover
The reason for requesting handover is to improve the load distribution with the neighbour cells.
Time Critical Handover
Handover is requested for time critical reason i.e. this cause value is reserved to represent all critical cases where the connection is likely to be dropped if handover is not performed.
TX2RELOCoverall Expiry
The reason for the action is expiry of timer TX2RELOCoverall.
TRELOCprep Expiry
Handover Preparation procedure is cancelled when timer TRELOCprep expires.
Unknown MME Code
The target eNB belongs to the same pool area of the source eNB and recognizes the MME Group ID. However, the MME Code is unknown to the target eNB.
Unknown New eNB UE X2AP ID 
The action failed because the New eNB UE X2AP ID or the MeNB UE X2AP ID is unknown.
Unknown Old eNB UE X2AP ID
The action failed because the Old eNB UE X2AP ID or the SeNB UE X2AP ID is unknown.
Unknown Pair of UE X2AP ID
The action failed because the pair of UE X2 AP IDs is unknown.
Encryption And/Or Integrity Protection Algorithms Not Supported
The target eNB is unable to support any of the encryption and/or integrity protection algorithms supported by the UE.
ReportCharacteristicsEmpty
The action failed because there is no characteristic reported.
NoReportPeriodicity
The action failed because the periodicity is not defined.
ExistingMeasurementID
The action failed because measurement-ID is already used.
Unknown eNB Measurement ID
The action failed because some eNB Measurement-ID is unknown.
Measurement Temporarily not Available
The eNB can temporarily not provide the requested measurement object.
Load Balancing
The reason for mobility settings change is load balancing.
Handover Optimisation
The reason for mobility settings change is handover optimisation.
Value out of allowed range
The action failed because the proposed Handover Trigger parameter change in the eNB2 Proposed Mobility Parameters IE is too low or too high.
Multiple E-RAB ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same E-RAB had been provided to the eNB.
Switch Off Ongoing
The reason for the action is an ongoing switch off i.e. the concerned cell will be switched off after offloading and not be available. It aides the receiving eNB in taking subsequent actions, e.g. selecting the target cell for subsequent handovers. 
Not supported QCI value
The action failed because the requested QCI is not supported.
Unspecified
Sent when none of the above cause values applies but still the cause is Radio Network Layer related.
Measurement not Supported For The Object
At least one of the concerned cell(s) does not support the requested measurement.
TDCoverall Expiry
The reason for the action is expiry of timer TDCoverall.
TDCprep Expiry
The reason for the action is expiry of timer TDCprep.
Action Desirable for Radio Reasons
The reason for requesting the action is radio related.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
X2AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [27] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [28].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the X2AP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of X2AP messages. X2AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an X2AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above, "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE IDs.
If an X2AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.3.2	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.
